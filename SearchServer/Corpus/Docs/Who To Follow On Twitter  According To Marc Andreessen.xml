He was prompted to do so by an article in The Information called “Silicon Valley’s Frontman Problem” by Jessica Lessin, who questioned if the industry leaders most often quoted by the media (she cited Andreessen, Elon Musk, and Peter Thiel) really “represent the views of the broader Silicon Valley community.” “The more media coverage Silicon Valley gets, the more important it is that other voices get heard,” Lessin wrote. (In addition to Lessin’s thought piece, New York magazine also just published an interview with Andreessen, in which he talked about the cultural changes in Silicon Valley since he arrived in 1994 and diversity in the tech industry, among other topics.) His list “only a highly abridged selection,” Andreessen (@pmarca) tweeted, but a helpful one because his public list of tech industry-related accounts has over 600 members. Since Andreessen’s prolific use of Twitter means his tweets tend to get buried quickly, TechCrunch has saved his highly abridged list for posterity here. 1/Jessica Lessin @Jessicalessin writing about “Silicon Valley’s Frontman Problem” aka “Peak Andreessen/Thiel/Musk”: https://t.co/DTNBkpzS0j — Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) October 19, 2014 2/She says “Silicon Valley has the microphone.
