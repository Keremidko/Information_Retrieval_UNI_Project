You can watch a replay of our hour-and-a-half long session in the embed below. In about an hour, TechCrunch is officially launching its new Twitch channel by streaming Bayonetta 2, the somewhat controversial action game that’s coming exclusively to Nintendo’s Wii U a week from today. As with its prequel, Bayonetta 2 puts players into the stilettos of its namesake female star, Bayonetta. She’s a witch who (and I’m simplifying things a lot here) draws her powers from her magical hair, which also happens to be what her skin-tight outfit is made of — so as you rack up combos and use more powerful attacks, some of her outfit disappears temporarily in proportion to the power of her moves. Some game critics consider it a cheap way to appeal to the male gaze. Others see Bayonetta as a uniquely badass, empowered woman in games. She’s like the Beyoncé of video game characters. I’m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt, but feel free to leave your thoughts in the chat box as I play — I’ll do my best to respond as I play.
