Today, she’s announcing her next venture, online training software startup Mindflash.com, where she will be its new president and CEO. Mindflash.com also launched today into private beta, and we have 750 invites for TechCrunch readers here. Mindflash will be adding people to the private beta in batches over the next two weeks. Mindflash.com is a portal small businesses can use to train employees. Geared towards non-technical users, Mindflash allows participants to upload and share training documents or videos on the web. They can even include quizzes to test employees’ comprehension of the content. The platform then manages the entire training management process – from sending training invitations to tracking employees’ progress to producing real-time progress reports. Wells says the main barrier to adoption of Mindflash’s platform is that small business owners may use tools like PowerPoint and email to employ training amongst employees. But Mindflash automates this and adds analytics to the mix so employers can ensure that employees are completing online training seminars. Mindflash.com investors include the Investment Group of Santa Barbara. Prior to her role at Mint.com, Wells was Senior Vice President of Marketing at Expedia in the US. Wells also led marketing efforts for Charles Schwab, and Intuit and American Express.</Content></Article>
