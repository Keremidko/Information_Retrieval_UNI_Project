RBRTS! Another day, another robotic Kickstarter project. This sassy little fellow is called Multiplo and it’s a cute robotics kit for DIYers and students. It will include servos, plates, arms, and a little Arduino controller to keep things rolling. The creators are aiming for $15,000 and they’re selling the robotics kit for $85. They’re not describing the exact kit yet but you’ll get platforms for the brain, servos, and other easy-to-connect pieces so you can build any number of robots including a crane, car, and Johnny-5-esque scream bot. The drive ends in 32 days and kits should ship shortly thereafter. Project Page</Content></Article>
