Inverters take direct current from power sources such as solar panels and turn it into alternate current so that it can be used in homes, cars and businesses. Making the inverter smaller allows for more cost effective options and would bring electricity to remote places on the planet. The application deadline is September 30 and the winner will be announced in January 2016. On July 22, 2015, registered teams will have to submit a technical approach and testing application. Google is partnering with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers for this contest. You can find more information about the program here.
