The company sold its CE business to the Japanese manufacturer Funai Electric Co. for $201 million. Like Cisco, Philips found the CE market fraught with peril. The 80-year-old Dutch company originally built radios but backed Betamax in the 1980s and continued selling televisions and optical disk players in a saturated market. With competitors coming from all sides, the most interesting thing Philips could produce was the Ambilight system for splashing color behind a television based on the video on the screen. That was clearly not enough to survive as a CE maker. “Since we have online entertainment, people do not buy Blu-ray and DVD players anymore,” said CEO Frans van Houten to the WSJ. The company saw a loss of $483 million which was double the loss in Q1 2011. CE is a slow-moving commodity now. Brand loyalty is dead and digital has made nearly every television the same. Philips’ decision to close up shop is a brave one and necessary. It will be interesting to see who else is taken up by the whirlwind of change coming to home CE.</Content></Article>
