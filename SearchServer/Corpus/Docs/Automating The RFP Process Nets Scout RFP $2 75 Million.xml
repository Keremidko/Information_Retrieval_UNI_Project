It’s a lengthy, time-consuming process still beset with reams of paperwork. At least, that’s the way the folks at Scout RFP look at it and at least some investors agree with them. The company has raised $2.75 million in seed financing from New Enterprise Associates, with participation from Google Ventures and Zapis Capital, to sell their service aimed at making the process easier. The cloud-based, sourcing-as-a-service platform automates several of the more labor-intensive aspects of the process for taking bids for new projects, and says it will use the new financing to build out its engineering team and expand the product for its big business customers. Using Scout RFP’s service, buyers can create a proposal in just a few minutes, because the company’s service is designed with a one-page bid template document. Because the data is centralized in one place, reviewing and analyzing data is simpler, according to the company. Based in Cleveland, Scout RFP was founded in 2013 and was initially backed by the company’s president, Stan Garber, and chief executive Alex Yakubovich, according to data from CrunchBase.
