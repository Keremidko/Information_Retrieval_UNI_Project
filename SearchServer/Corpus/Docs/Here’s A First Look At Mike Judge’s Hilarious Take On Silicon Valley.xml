Mike Judge’s long-awaited and irreverent take on the tech scene in Silicon Valley — creatively titled Silicon Valley — debuts April 6 on HBO. And we’ve got your first look at the show’s trailer, which debuts on the premium cable channel this weekend. The series, which was created by the Beavis &amp; Butthead and Office Space creator Judge along with co-conspirators John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky, is inspired in part by his own experience as a Silicon Valley engineer in the ’80s. Set in the present day, it follows a rag-tag group of founders as they navigate the world of startup incubators, venture capitalists, and yes, even the local tech blogs… all in the search for fame and fortune. The cast includes Thomas Middleditch as Richard, an introverted programmer who starts out living with Big Head (Josh Brener), Gilfoyle (Martin Starr), and Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) in a so-called hacker hostel run by dot-com millionaire Erlich (T.J. Miller). After a failed pitch to billionaire venture capitalist Peter Gregory (Christopher Evan Welch), wackiness ensues. Clearly I’ve given away too much of the plot already, and you should probably just watch the trailer embedded above. Anyway, the first episode premieres Sunday, April 6 and I, for one, can’t wait to see it.</Content></Article>
