Kalanick discussed Uber’s struggles against regulators, expansion and competition with TechCrunch co-editor Alexia Tsotsis at TechCrunch Disrupt today. “Competition is good,” Kalanick said. “If somebody can offer value at a cheaper price, they should. But that also means Uber should, too.” Tsotsis asked Kalanick for exact numbers on Uber’s size and Kalanick said Uber is doing hundreds of thousands of hours per week in total rides. “Competition is fun,” Kalanick said. “That shit is fun. Let’s go.” Facebook LinkedIn Travis Kalanick Onstage at Disrupt</Content></Article>
