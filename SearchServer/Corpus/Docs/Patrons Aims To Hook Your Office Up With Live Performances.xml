The idea is that the artist can pick up an extra gig while in town for another performance. It’s an offshoot from live music booking marketplace Gigit. According to founder Tegan Gaan, you can also book yoga instructors and all sorts of other performers on the app, too. We used Patrons to get “Act as If” to come play at TechCrunch headquarters here in San Francisco. It was a sort of NPR style “Tiny Desk Concert.” I sat down with Gaan before the band went on to learn a bit more about how the app works.

The band is starting to blow up on the music scene. They’ve already been featured in the CW’s Pretty Little Liars, an Apple commercial for the OS X Lion and MTV’s Jersey Shore. Act as If just dropped their new album, “Steady.” Several outlets have started to feature music from the album, including KROQ, Fuse, Buzz Bands LA, Pure Volume and Buzznet.
