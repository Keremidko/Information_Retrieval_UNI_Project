The surface event is confirmed, and reports suggest that there will be a smaller version of the Surface called the “Surface Mini” shown off there, a new support document (via Verge) suggests we’ll also see a full-fledged follow-up to its Intel-based Surface Pro devices. The reference comes from a new support article published by Microsoft that references support being added to Windows 8.1 for the “Surface Pro 3 camera.” Previously, CNET had reported that Microsoft would be adding a new Intel-based device to the lineup in addition to the Qualcomm-based Surface Mini that is supposedly coming. Surface revenue was up year-over-year this past quarter according to Microsoft, but that still doesn’t necessarily translate into all that many devices sold. The device isn’t selling anywhere near on the level of the iPad, for instance, even by the rosiest estimates, but Microsoft seems committed to the platform regardless. The Surface does do the work of a reference design, like a Google Nexus handset, since it also presents Windows 8 in as perfect a setting as that hybrid OS could possibly hope for, which is something the company desperately needs as it tries to find its footing with the next generation of Windows software. A new model would be fairly quick on the heels of the Surface Pro 2, which was released in October, but the original Surface Pro was launched in February 2013, so Microsoft isn’t committed to a yearly schedule or anything here. Either way, we’ll find out May 20 when Microsoft holds its New York event to talk about what’s next for its homegrown tablet hardware.</Content></Article>
