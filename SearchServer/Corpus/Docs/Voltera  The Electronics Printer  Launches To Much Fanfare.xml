The company appeared on our stage at CES 2015 and showed of an early working prototype. Now, however, they’re ready to take orders and start shipping. The printer is essentially a PCB maker. You put in a board, upload a circuit diagram, and the system draws it in conductive ink. You can then solder in the proper components. The system costs $1,499 for early birds (cheaper units have already sold out) and the company hit $200,000 of their $50,000 goal. They aim to ship in a year but I’ve seen this thing live and working so I can only imagine they’ll have to deal with supply chain issues rather than R&amp;D and prototyping. It’s a fascinating product with a very specific audience and if I was smart enough to need to make PCBs I’d totally pick one up. You can see the team presenting at Hardware Alley below.
