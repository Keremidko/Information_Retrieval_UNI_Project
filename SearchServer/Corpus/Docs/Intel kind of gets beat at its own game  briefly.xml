The board transcoded 1080p H.264 video to a smaller resolution in about half the time as an Intel Core2 Quad. It’s even more impressive when you read that the li’l Cell is about half as powerful as the big daddy Cell found in the PS3. If you’re thinking, “Wow, how does that happen?” remember this was a situation where the application was optimized for that specific board. So you wouldn’t get results like this in every situation. Still, it shows that Intel is far from untouchable and while they may rule the desktops right now, these little optimized processors are still excellent choices for more specific systems.</Content></Article>
