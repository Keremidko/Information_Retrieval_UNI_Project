From Gizmodo to Gawker.com, Kotaku, Jezebel and Lifehacker, every visitor to the sites operated by the new media company is being served a dry message that reads ‘Http/1.1 Service Unavailable’. I’ve been checking out some of the Twitter feeds of said blogs, as well as that of founder Nick Denton (whose personal blog is also down), but it appears they’re either not yet aware of the issue – rather unlikely – or too busy getting things back up again to let their respective audiences know what’s up (or down, rather). Update: and they’re all back – Gawker tech is holding the servers differently now :) I’m not sure just how big Gawker Media is, but in terms of reach, it’s very big. The last report I can find on its traffic numbers date back to November 2009, when Denton said the company’s network was at nearly 400 million pageviews a month, with not a single blog getting under 20 million pageviews per month.</Content></Article>
