The point of the challenge is that you perform it, then challenge others, who must either also douse themselves in ice water or make a donation instead. Schiller posted a sequence of images of himself performing the challenge to his Twitter account, standing on what looks like the most amazing beach and looking pretty pleased with the results. Phil then challenged a number of others, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, and former Robin portrayer Chris O’Donnell for some reason. Phil takes challenge! Challenges Chris, Kim, and Tim. #IceBucketChallenge @PeteFrates3 @tim_cook @chrisodonnell #ALS http://t.co/DfJIuY3hnb— Philip Schiller (@pschiller) August 14, 2014 Cook completing the challenge would definitely be a sight to behold, especially if, as at least one Twitter use suggested, he did so on stage during the upcoming iPhone unveiling. Either way, it’s a worthy cause, and it’s nice to see something meritorious turn so viral instead of the usual fluff. Other tech notables who have also done the challenge so far include Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, to name just a few.</Content></Article>
