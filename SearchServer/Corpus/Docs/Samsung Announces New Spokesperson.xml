As a former semi-professional magician, Gob knows that it’s important to create the illusion that Samsung makes decent products. Already, the board members have been extremely pleased with his work, pointing out that you must take a loss to receive a gain (or something like that). In the coming months, Gob will perform a series of magical and musical acts to impress investors and to restore confidence in the company. You can catch the act on the following dates: Friday, April 6th – 8pm @ Jacob Javits Center, NYC Wednesday, April 11th – 8:30pm @ The Sands Resort and Casino, Las Vegas Saturday, April 14th – 10:00pm @ Borgata, Atlantic City Each ticket is $100 and goes directly to the Samsung Charity for the Magicians Alliance of America. When asked about how he felt being chose as the new spokesperson for Samsung, Bluth replied: “I just want to let everyone know that I’ll be giving it my all – 93% – for everyone looking up to Samsung as a telecom company. I like what they’re doing with some of the products like the Blackjack and I intend to help sell as many units as possible. Even if it means stealing a few crates-worth and dumping them into the bay.” Press Release [Samsung]</Content></Article>
