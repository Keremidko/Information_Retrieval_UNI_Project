One developer found a very interesting easter egg within Glass itself, which introduces you to the entire Glass team. The steps to reproduce it are fairly simple: Settings -&gt; Device info -&gt; View licenses -&gt; Tap the touchpad 9 times -&gt; Tap Meet Team Here’s a video demo, including the neat sounds that happen as you keep tapping: Facebook LinkedIn Google Glass “Meet The Team” Easter Egg The neat part about the photo is that you can see the entire 360-degree panoramic image by moving your head around. This was hard to show in the MyGlass screencast, since it lags a little bit. We’ve learned that Mike LeBeau, Senior Software Engineer for Google X, is the one who dropped the hidden gem into Glass’ software. He’s appeared on TechCrunch before in a &lt;a target="_blank" href="“&gt;hilarious Google blooper reel. The team photo has Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, front and center. I’m sure that more of these easter eggs will pop up over time, but this one is particularly cool since it’s the first time that I’ve seen a panoramic image on the device since I started using it. This functionality could be something that isn’t exposed in the Mirror API as of yet, but once it is, it’ll be a fun one.</Content></Article>
