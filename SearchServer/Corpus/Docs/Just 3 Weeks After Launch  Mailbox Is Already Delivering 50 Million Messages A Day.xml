The downside to that early success is that new users are added to a waiting list as Mailbox tries to keep up with demand. The company has processed about 500,000 applications so far, but it expects the number of people on the waiting list to increase according to its current growth curve. To handle email snoozing and push notifications, Mailbox checks your email from the cloud and reformats it before sending it to users. As a result, the service needs to ensure that it has enough capacity to scale up with demand as new users are added. But the number of users and number of messages that are processed has been huge. “We’re delivering about 50 million messages a day right now,” Underwood told me. That’s after just three weeks into its public launch. Just to put that into perspective, he said it took Twitter three years before it had the infrastructure to process the same amount of messages. Of course, that’s because Mailbox is trying to manage a whole lot of existing content in people’s email inboxes. We spent a few minutes with Underwood to chat about the company’s launch and its growth over the last several weeks, and to get a quick demo of the app. Check out the video above to see what you’re missing out on, if you haven’t already signed up for Mailbox.</Content></Article>
