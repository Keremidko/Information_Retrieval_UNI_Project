It’s coming to Netflix on Saturday and will stream to subscribers for no additional cost. Netflix announced today that the scandalous Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy will be available to its U.S. and Canadian subscribers starting on Saturday. The terms of the deal were not announced, but this gives Sony another revenue stream for the film that is just barely covering its $46 million production costs. Sony announced today that The Interview brought in $40 million from on-demand rentals and another $6 million from theaters. The Interview was already available from various sources including YouTube and Amazon, but both services required users to rent the movie for a few dollars. Now it’s available to all of Netflix’s 39 million subscribers.</Content></Article>
