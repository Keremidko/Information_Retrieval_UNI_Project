Back then, in 2013, it was one of the weirder things to come through the TechCrunch inboxes. Blinding you, and muffling your ears from the rest of the world, the Ostrich Pillow was meant to be your portable nap in a bag, with holes for your head and mouth/nose, as well as your arms if you wanted to lay your head down on a table. If you’re in the airport and don’t mind having your things stolen, or at the library and don’t mind having your things stolen, or at the park and don’t mind having your things stolen, it was a great product. Today, the company has made the Ostrich Pillow even more accessible by enhancing security. With the Ostrich Pillow Mini, users can rest their head on a pillow without sacrificing their sense of sight or sound, or binding their hands above their head. The Ostrich Pillow Mini is also actually portable. Whereas the original Ostrich Pillow was too big to really take on a plane or with you throughout the day, the Ostrich Pillow Mini is about the size of a neck pillow that you’d take on the plane. The Kickstarter page for the mini Ostrich Pillow is live now, so you can check it out here if you want.</Content></Article>
