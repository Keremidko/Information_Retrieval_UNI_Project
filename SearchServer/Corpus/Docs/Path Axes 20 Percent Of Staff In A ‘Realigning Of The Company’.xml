Rumors of the layoffs have been percolating around the tech industry this afternoon, and were first confirmed by Valleywag. Path founder and CEO Dave Morin, who celebrated his 33rd birthday yesterday, has not responded to requests for comment. In a phone call today, a Path spokesperson told TechCrunch that the layoffs represent a “realigning of the company” as it places a “huge focus on Path 4,” the next version of its app. We’re hearing that the layoffs affected primarily data and marketing operations, but Path would not confirm what departments were affected, saying only that “it was across the organization.” The spokesperson said that Path currently has 20 million users — but she would not say how many of those have purchased $14.99 paid subscriptions to the app. Presumably, not enough to cover the costs of the 50-person headcount that Path had until today. Path has raised $41.2 million in venture capital funding since it was founded three years ago, in November 2010. The company has been said to be in talks for tens of millions of dollars in new funding for months now, but it appears that as of today a deal has yet to be closed.</Content></Article>
