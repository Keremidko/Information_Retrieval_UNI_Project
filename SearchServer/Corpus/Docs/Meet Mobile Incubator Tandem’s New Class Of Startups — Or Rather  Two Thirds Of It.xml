Co-founder Doug Renert (pictured) told me that Tandem will start accepting larger class sizes next year, following the raising of its third fund (which, according to an SEC filing, was expected to total $100 million). The goal is eight startups, though there may be a “ramping up” period where it’s somewhere in between. Not only has Tandem brought on more partners and made plans to back more startups — it’s expanding its physical footprint too. The accelerator initially turned a single house in the Silicon Valley city of Burlingame into a live-work space for its companies, and Renert said it now occupies the two adjacent homes, turning the street into a “mini campus” of sorts. Here are the three startups occupying that mini campus for the next six months. The third is still in stealth mode, so Renert would only talk about it in a semi-vague way. Zmenu — A startup that’s trying to enrich restaurant menus with crowdsourced images. Currently running a limited test in a few Bay Area locations. Bitcovery — An app for people to discover for digital media and goods based on social recommendations. It launched at our Disrupt conference in September. You can download it here. Stealth startup — Renert would only say that it’s a marketing and publishing platform for crowdfunding campaigns, including those run by Tandem companies. Oh, if you’re interested in applying for the next class, the deadline is December 1.</Content></Article>
