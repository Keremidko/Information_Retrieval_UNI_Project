Still keeping your juices on the inside? Good, because we’re still not quite at the robot dystopia stage but we’re getting there. Our first contender for TIDWRTWHUFOO of the week is this robotic gecko that, aside from looking cute, can scuttle up walls and glass. The Gecko uses van der Waals’ forces to stick to surfaces thanks to tiny little hairs on its feet to scare the dickens out of you. It’s not all fun and games for the geckos, which is why this new model is so cool. While roboticists have been able to replicate functional gecko toes for a while now, there’s a lot more that the geckos themselves have going for them besides just their toe material. Because of the molecular bonding, the material sticks to everything, which means that the geckos spend a lot of time trying to keep their toes clean. Don’t think robots can rock out? Well they definitely can, as evidenced by this video by KMel Robotics. These amazing quadcopters are busy playing Thus Spoke Zarathustra as well as some Christmas melodies, beautiful renditions all. But what will happen when the robots decide to play this beautiful music on our bones and organs? We will be powerless. Such beauty hides such violence! Finally, meet Cubli, a jumping, moving cube that can stand on its corners and scoot around with no visible means of control. That’s right: this thing is witchcraft! Don’t let it haunt your dreams, friends, because the end is nigh and you’ll need your rest!</Content></Article>
