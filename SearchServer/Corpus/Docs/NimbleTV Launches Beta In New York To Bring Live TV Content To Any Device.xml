This lets users stream TV content directly to the device of their choosing, including the computer, tablet or smartphone. Not only do NimbleTV subscribers get access on any device they’d like, but the app offers unlimited recording like a DVR system along with a channel guide. NimbleTV has even added social features to make sure users can find what they’re looking for on the service. The service is currently only available in New York city as a beta, but the company has plans to roll out its software in the U.S. and India, and eventually globally, as soon as possible. Unlike Aereo, which streams content from free over-the-air signals, NimbleTV lets users get subscription content by acting as the payment provider between the consumer and the TV provider. Users can choose with providers they want, and select a payment package based on their cable needs, along with standard local coverage. Getting into the streaming TV space is difficult, but worthwhile. Customers are clamoring for affordable pricing and device freedom, however, the broadcast networks and cable providers are forces to be reckoned with. Aereo is currently in the middle of a huge lawsuit for streaming content on its service, and NimbleTV will likely run into similar obstacles. For now, however, the company is just excited to have its service finally available to users.</Content></Article>
