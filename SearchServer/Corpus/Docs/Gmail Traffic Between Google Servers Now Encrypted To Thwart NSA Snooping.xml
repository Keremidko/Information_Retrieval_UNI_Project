As of today, Gmail will “always use an encrypted HTTPS connection” whenever a user checks their mail, or sends a new missive. According to Google, the expanded protection will ensure that your mail is safe from being snooped on as it travels from your machine to Google’s data centers. This means you are protected regardless of what sort of network you are logged into, either a public connection or whatever else. Perhaps even more importantly now, messages inside of the Google datacenter network will be encrypted — so as your note moves from one Gmail server to another, it will be protected. This matters as it was revealed recently that the NSA was tapping the cables between foreign data centers of United States technology companies, to mine information directly. Google delicately calls the effort a “top priority after last summer’s revelations.” In other words: Back off, NSA. The above must and will become the default for more than email, I think. Encryption should be pervasive and airtight, both internally and externally. Startups are beginning to follow this arc of history. Convo recently implemented at-rest encryption, and so forth. If they won’t keep their damn hands off our stuff, we can make sure at least that what they steal they can’t read.
