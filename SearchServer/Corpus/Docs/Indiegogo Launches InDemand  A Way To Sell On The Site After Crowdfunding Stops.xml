Essentially the platform allows users to sell pre-orders after crowdfunding and manage customers using the site’s platform. The service allows creators to raise additional funding and manage customer orders. It also uses Indiegogo’s SEO and promotion platforms to spread the word about completed projects. It’s open to any successfully crowdfunded project. The company has piloted the system with a number of campaigns including Bluesmart and the Core. It will be open to all Indiegogo users.</Content></Article>
