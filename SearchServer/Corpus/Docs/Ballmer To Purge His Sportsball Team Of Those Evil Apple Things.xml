In an interview with Reuters, Ballmer indicated that his team, the one he paid $2 billion for, won’t use Apple tech. Nope. It’s Microsoft all the way down: “Most of the Clippers on are Windows, some of the players and coaches are not,” Ballmer said. “And Doc kind of knows that’s a project. It’s one of the first things he said to me: ‘We are probably going to get rid of these iPads, aren’t we?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, we probably are.’ But I promised we would do it during the off season.” Sorry. Your iPad will have to go. It isn’t immediately clear what impact the change will have on the performance of the team.
