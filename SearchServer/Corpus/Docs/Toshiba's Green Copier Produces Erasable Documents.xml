The way it works is that documents can be turned blank by heating them with a special device. For the copier, Toshiba uses a special toner, which loses its color when heated (and is offered by Japanese company Pilot). The printouts can be reused at least five times, which results in a 60% cut in carbon dioxide emissions, when compared with using four sheets of paper. The copier can make 20 to 30 copies a minute and will cost about 20-30% more than conventional copiers with a similar performance, according to a report in The Nikkei (Japan’s biggest business daily). Toshiba says they will start commercializing the copy machines sometime next fiscal, between October 2011 and March 2012, aiming at businesses and government bodies.</Content></Article>
