Humans are weird animals, covered in hair and full of blood and stuff and getting to know one or two for the purposes of procreation or whatever is really hard. But not if you have Tinder! It’s a dating app that lets you pick people based on appearance. But what if you really can’t tell if a human is pretty? That’s a stumper but finally, there’s a robot that can help you out. The T Machine by Julian Heden is a very powerful system for meeting humans. It consists of a Raspberry Pi connected to a motor that is, in turn, connected to a tablet pen. The robot then selects every face that appears, thereby ensuring maximum potential mate acquisition. It’s not very smart but it gets the job done and it saves wear and tear on your joints. Didn’t like the lady or man you swiped? Who cares. Humans are humans and they’re mostly all alike except for sports players. Now if there was only a robot that could help us make small talk and order from a restaurant menu… entrepreneurs?</Content></Article>
