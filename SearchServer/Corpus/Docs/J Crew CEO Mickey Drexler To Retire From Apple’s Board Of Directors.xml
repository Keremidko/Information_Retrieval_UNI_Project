His role will end in March; no one has been named to fill the vacancy. In addition to his position on Apple’s board, Drexler has been the CEO of J.Crew since 2003. Prior to that, he was the CEO of Gap Inc. (the parent co of The Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy, among others). Steve Jobs pulled Drexler onto the company’s board in 1999, largely to help them build its retail presence. Apple opened the first of its now iconic retail stores two years later in 2001. Drexler was the longest tenured member of Apple’s board of directors after Bill Campbell stepped down in July of last year. Featured Image: Seth Wenig/AP</Content></Article>
