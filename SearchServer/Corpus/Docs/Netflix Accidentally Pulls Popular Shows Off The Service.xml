Hell hath no fury like the scorn of someone halfway through a HIMYM marathon. Alongside reports on Twitter, Netflix has also confirmed the issue on Twitter and is telling everyone not to panic. See, the issue isn’t that Netflix is down, per se. However, many of the popular shows that have been available for a long time on Netflix Watch Instantly were suddenly removed. These shows include Dexter, House, Grey’s Anatomy, How I Met Your Mother, Suits and I’m sure many, many more.
