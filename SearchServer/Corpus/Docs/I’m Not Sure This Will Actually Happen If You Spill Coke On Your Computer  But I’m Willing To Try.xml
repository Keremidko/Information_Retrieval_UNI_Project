You know the one. It opens with a weird montage of people who are sad because of the Internet, then segues into a Tron-style data center, where some guy spills Coke on a server. Now, you might think that this would be bad news, but no! Instead of everything breaking down, some puzzling combination of Coca Cola and positive emotions floods everyone’s computer, and everything is great. To be honest, I’m not sure this is a 100 percent accurate representation of how technology works. Nonetheless, it represents an interesting new social media campaign (which Coca Cola is also promoting on Twitter, natch). As explained on the Make It Happy website, you’re supposed to find negative tweets, then reply to them with the #MakeItHappy hashtag. Coke, in turn, will “respond with a happy piece of art made from their post.” @mstisamarie #MakeItHappy is more than a hashtag. Reply to negative Tweets and see! http://t.co/kazqupgXKm pic.twitter.com/UOAfuoW5OJ — Coca-Cola (@CocaCola) February 2, 2015 What does that have to do with Coca Cola? I couldn’t tell ya. Is positivity inherently better than negativity? Not necessarily, in my opinion. And will this actually make the Internet a more positive place? Probably not. But hey, the art made me smile. Especially after the unrelenting bleakness of all those other Super Bowl commercials.</Content></Article>
