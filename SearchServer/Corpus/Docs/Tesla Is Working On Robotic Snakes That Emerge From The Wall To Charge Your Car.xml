Btw, we are actually working on a charger that automatically moves out from the wall &amp; connects like a solid metal snake. For realz. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 31, 2014 This would presumably somewhat resemble the kind of articulated robotic arms made famous by comic book villain Doctor Octopus, but less threatening and evil. The invention would appear to be driven by a desire to make the process of charging Tesla vehicles even more convenient, and also by extension more idiot-proof – you can’t forget to plug in your car when the plug is autonomous, after all. This can be used with all existing Model S cars, not just futures ones. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 31, 2014 Backwards compatibility for said tech is a nice bonus, and yet another example of how Tesla goes out of its way to bring the benefits of its advances to existing, as well as new customers. Already, Tesla has begun rolling out battery swap tech that works with existing cars, and earlier this year it introduced a warranty extension that applied backwards to existing Model S cars already shipped.  </Content></Article>
