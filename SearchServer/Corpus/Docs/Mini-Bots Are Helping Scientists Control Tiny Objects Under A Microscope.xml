The video above, filmed by AtoZNano, shows the miBots in action. Theyâ€™re controlled via a joystick-like interface and the tiny probe can measure wires and nanotubes and can even help out in medical situations. These tiny robots are obviously going to be expensive for the average user, but I could imagine a similar robot that could help electronics hackers control their projects at a microscopic level and move small parts around a PCB or bread board. The little robot could act as a helping hand and help steady solder points and builds with its tiny probe. Cool, cool stuff. via Simplebotics</Content></Article>
