Ergo, she’s been working to change that, on her mission to turn an overlooked legacy web property into a “digital daily habit” fit for a mobile obsessed era — promoting Adam Cahan to head up the division, ramping up on app devs (including acquihiring a flotilla of startups) and turning out some polished own-brand apps. Next on the agenda — for early 2015 — a mobile developer conference, leveraging the intel of mobile analytics firm Flurry, which Yahoo picked up in July. It’s not hard to see why Mayer wanted Flurry: the firm provides the data-based substance to draw a wider community of mobile devs into orbit around the Yahoo brand. Or that’s the hope. Yahoo losing out in the interest stakes to shinier tech brands continues to be Mayer’s sweating toil — and explains why she’s been on such a startup buying spree, as a strategy to suck some tech talent away from Google, Facebook, Twitter et al. (The latter held the first of its new annual mobile dev conferences in October.) Yahoo said today its free-to-attend conference will include the launch of a suite of tools to help mobile devs “better understand their users and improve, grow and monetize their apps.” So that’s Mayer waving a monetization carrot to encourage devs to flock to the Yahoo banner. Yahoo’s VP of Flurry products, Simon Khalaf, will be given the conference platform for a ‘State of Mobile’ address, along with other as yet unannounced internal speakers from Yahoo, and external speakers from the app world, plus the breakout sessions for devs to troubleshoot their app issues. The conference — billed as Yahoo’s first — will take place on February 19 in San Francisco. Devs can sign up for more info here.</Content></Article>
