The hidden, fun feature in Android 5 is accessible via the Settings menu, with repeated tapping on the Android version number listing, and gives users the chance to play through an Android Lollipop-themed version of the viral hit Flappy Bird. The game looks fun and diverting, and it’s included in Android 5-running devices for free. This isn’t the final shipping version of Lollipop, and we’ll have to wait until we get our hands on some new Nexus hardware before we can verify it makes it through to that version, too, but generally speaking, Google does offer some kind of Easter Egg in its shipping software updates. Unlike Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen, however, whoever was responsible for this game at Google probably won’t have an apparent existential crisis, pull the software, go into hiding in Vietnam and return later with sequels that have nowhere near the viral potential of the original.</Content></Article>
