The new device runs a 1.7GHz processor with 2GB RAM. It has a screen density of 2560×1600 pixels which is a bit higher than Apple’s 2048×1536 iPad display. Google’s official PR didn’t note much about the new devices but a recent leak told us more than enough about the new device. Dubbed the “the ultimate tablet for watching movies or reading magazines,” the Nexus 10 runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and front and rear-facing cameras. It will come in 16GB ($399) and 32GB ($499) configurations and is available on 11/13.</Content></Article>
