Donations to the ALS Association are up by 1000%. Plus we get to see people like Zuck dump friggin’ ice on their heads. ALS, or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that attacks the brain and spinal cord. You can find more information here, and donate to the ALS Association here. Following up on a challenge from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Zuck dumped the bucket on himself in what seems to be his backyard. And since it’s tradition to pass the icey-torch onto at least three people, he called out Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, and Reed Hastings to do it next. Seriously though: if Bill Gates does it, I think we’ve reached max absurdity. Game over, achievement unlocked.</Content></Article>
