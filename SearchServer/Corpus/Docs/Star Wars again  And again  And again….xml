That’s all it takes. One. And then you can milk it forever, diluting the original source material until it is just a pale puddle worthy of no attention at all. Star Wars is going 3-D. The original six episodes are getting yet another treatment as Jeffrey Katzenberg from DreamWorks Animations confirmed that George Lucas has the will and the way. Look for Lucasfilm to add to its already considerable portfolio of expertise as Star Wars, yet again is a driving vehicle to showcase their talent. I guess that technically makes it two good ideas, with Star Wars feeding the second one, Lucasfilm. Oh, and of course the similarly fated Indiana Jones franchise. That was started off good too, before delving into a similar fate. Three. Three good ideas. I’m gonna stop counting now, and go watch Star Wars on Beta.</Content></Article>
