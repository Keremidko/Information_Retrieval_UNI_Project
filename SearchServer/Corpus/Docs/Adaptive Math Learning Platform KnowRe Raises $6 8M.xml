The funding was led by returning investor SoftBank Ventures Korea, with participation from KTB Network Partners Fund, Partners Investment, and SparkLabs Global Ventures. In a statement, KnowRe co-founder and co-CEO David Joo said the company’s Series A “allows us to scale our distribution in the U.S. on the heels of strong demand from schools and districts at our launch and further our product development and offerings for the U.S., Korea, and broader Asian markets.” KnowRe was first profiled by TechCrunch in January 2013, when it raised $1.4 million from SoftBank Ventures Korea for its adaptive learning platform. The site’s technology personalizes lessons for each student depending on their progress. The platform is intended to be used by teachers as part of homework assignments or with tutors and educators during classes. The site officially launched earlier this year after a year-long pilot program in dozens of middle and high schools across the U.S. It was named first place winner and “best instructional app” by the New York City Department of Education in the 2013 Gap App Challenge and was recently selected as a semi-finalist in the Robin Hood College Success Prize.</Content></Article>
