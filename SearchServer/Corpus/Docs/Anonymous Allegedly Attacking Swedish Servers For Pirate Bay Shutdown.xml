Anonymous also attacked Swedish ISP Telia. It should be noted that the demise of The Pirate Bay did nothing to stem the tide of piracy. Variety writes: ￼The result: The total number of IP addresses engaged in peer-to-peer downloads of content tracked by Excipio dropped slightly from 99.0 million on Dec. 9 to 95.0 million and 95.6 million the following two days, before bouncing back to 100.2 million on Friday, Dec. 12. That’s roughly in line with the daily average of 99.9 million since Nov. 1, according to Excipio.</Content></Article>
