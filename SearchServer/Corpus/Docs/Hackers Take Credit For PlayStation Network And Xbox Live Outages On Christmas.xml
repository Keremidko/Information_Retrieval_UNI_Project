On what might be the biggest gaming day of the year, a hacker group called Lizard Squad is claiming responsibility for taking down both Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. Reports of service disruptions began popping up earlier today, with both Xbox Live and PlayStation Network acknowledging issues with some core services. In both cases, users have had a difficult time logging in to the networks, which generally gives them access to connect with friends and play games requiring online access. We are aware that there have been issues reported with PSN. Thanks for your patience as we investigate. — Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) December 24, 2014 A hacker group called Lizard Squad claims to be behind the attacks, which follow weeks of threatening to take the systems offline. This is the same group that said it was behind PlayStation Network and Blizzard outages in August that took down games like League of Legends and Path of Exile. PSN AND XBOX #OFFLINE — Lizard Squad (@FUCKCRUCIFIX) December 25, 2014 For those who just got a shiny new PS4 or XBOne for Christmas, the attack couldn’t have come at a worse time. That’s because new users generally have to be connected to one of those networks even just to set up their Xbox or PlayStation accounts for the first time. And what are those gamers supposed to do for the rest of the day? Spend time with their families?</Content></Article>
