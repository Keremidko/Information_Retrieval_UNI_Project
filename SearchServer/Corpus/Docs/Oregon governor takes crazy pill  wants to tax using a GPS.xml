Because fuel-efficient cars are becoming so common, tax funds for road maintenance (based on gas taxes in oregon) are being reduced. As a possible solution, the governer of Oregon wants to install GPS into cars, and then every time you fill up your car, a tax is levied. I personally have issues with this. What’s next? Automatically issuing tickets if you go too fast? Plus, having lived in Oregon, I would be deeply concerned about the gas station owners collecting and paying the tax.</Content></Article>
