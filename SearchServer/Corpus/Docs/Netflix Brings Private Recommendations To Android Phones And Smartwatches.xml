The update means that Netflix for Android users can privately share and receive recommendations from friends right from their phone, but the service also supports notifications for those who own Android Wear-powered smartwatches. Netflix’s Android Wear integration issues a ping to the wrist when a user receives a recommendation. Triggering the alert lets them watch the content (on their phone, not the watch), thank their friend or pull up more details about the show. While I’m a big fan of private recommendations, I’m still struggling to find a Killer Feature that nudges me into buying a smartwatch. Netflix’s integration isn’t the answer, but I can appreciate that it is a neat way to handle notifications on the fly… but Netflix shows are best consumed on a larger, non-mobile screen anyway.
