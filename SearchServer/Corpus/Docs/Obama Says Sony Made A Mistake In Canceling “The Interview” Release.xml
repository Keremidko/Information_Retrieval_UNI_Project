So does President Barack Obama. In a statement during a press conference this afternoon, President Obama said: “I am sympathetic to the concerns that [Sony] faced. Having said all that, yes, they made a mistake. We cannot have a society where a dictator someplace else can start imposing censorship here in the United States. That’s not who we are. That’s not what America is.” He continues: “I’m sympathetic that Sony as a private company was worried about liability, but I wish they’d spoken to me first. I would’ve told them do not get into a pattern in which you are intimidated by those kinds of criminal attacks “We can’t start changing our behaviors, any more then we’d stop going to football games because of the possibility of a terrorist attack.” Featured Image: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/Getty Images</Content></Article>
