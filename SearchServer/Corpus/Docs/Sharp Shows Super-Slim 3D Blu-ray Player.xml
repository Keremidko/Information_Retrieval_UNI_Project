The company also showed [JP] the BD-HP90 today, a 3D Blu-ray player that’s just 35mm thick. Needless to say, this makes the device the thinnest of its kind. The player is not only thin, but it can also be used both in a horizontal and vertical position (as you can see above). It comes with a USB port, an HDMI interface, Ethernet, and AQUOS Link. It can play 3D Blu-ray discs but doesn’t support BDXL. Sharp plans to start selling the BD-HP90 in Japan on November 20 for $495 (no word yet on availability).</Content></Article>
