The NSA denies that. An NSA statement from last December is clear: “after extensive investigation, including interviews with his former NSA supervisors and co-workers, we have not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden’s contention that he brought these matters to anyone’s attention.” Today’s FOIA response maintains the NSA’s previous position: At the end of the response, there’s an interesting paragraph: So, the email that the NSA released previously, in which Snowden asked questions relating to executive orders, and Department of Defense regulations, didn’t match Leopold’s request in the view of the NSA. Therefore, if there are other Snowden emails asking similar questions, they would not have been included in the NSA’s response, perhaps. Here’s the released email: What we need now is a new Edward Snowden to Edward Snowden Edward Snowden’s old correspondence en masse. I’m kidding. The NSA declined to comment.
