But Apple didn’t really have its own fitness app until now. Today at WWDC, Apple formally introduced HealthKit for iOS 8, the company’s first real big foray into health and fitness tracking, and Health, an app for viewing all that info. Just as Passbook was launched as a single app where iOS users could store coupons, movie tickets, and other items, HealthKit and the new Health app will combine data from various different health and fitness devices and apps, and make them accessible all in one place. A new health app had been widely expected, as it was first reported in January and later images of the application leaked to 9to5Mac. Health will be able to source some user activity data in newer iOS devices, thanks to Apple’s M7 motion-tracking chip. But it will also tie into other quantified self-tracking apps and devices, and combine their data into one slick new user interface. Apple exec Craig Federighi mentioned Nike and the Mayo Clinic as partners, but more third-party developers will likely participate.</Content></Article>
