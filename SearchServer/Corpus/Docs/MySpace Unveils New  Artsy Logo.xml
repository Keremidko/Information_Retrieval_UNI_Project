Today at the Warm Gun Design conference in San Francisco, butt of too many design/user experience jokes to mention social networking site MySpace unveils their new logo which is, get this, the word “my” in Helvetica and then a symbol delineating a space. MySpace VP of User Experience Mike Macadaan explains the philosophy behind it, “MySpace is a platform for people to be whatever they want, so we’ve decided to give them the space to do it.” Apparently the blank space to the left will be filled with user generated artwork when users hover over it on the redesigned site, like this: If the iTunes 10 logo and Gap logo fiascos have taught us anything, it’s that people hate logo change, so people are inevitably going to hate this (I can’t wait for the comments section of this post). But, in all fairness, the new logo’s art school abstractness and UGC element is better than the human centipede + Arial “myspace” blandness of the old logo (see above), and from Macadaan’s presentation it looks like it will have some Google Doodle-like interactive features once the MySpace redesign launches as the end of this year. In any case, please put your inevitable redesign suggestions the comments, or on Dribbble if you prefer.</Content></Article>
