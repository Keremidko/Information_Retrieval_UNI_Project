Keep it in your pocket, and when you’ve got an image you want to print, just send it to the tiny printer from your camera to have a regular-sized, sticky print in just under a minute. If you’re old school, you can shake it while it comes out. It connects via USB or Bluetooth. The ink isn’t inkjet, meaning it’s more water resistant (and hopefully less expensive). We’re going to try to get a demo unit of this sexy box for sure. Hit the link to see a video of the device in action. Exclusive Video: Polaroid’s ZINK printer [T3]</Content></Article>
