The arguments supporting these additions were made in federal court in San Jose today, and follow Samsung’s expressed intent to add the iPhone 5 its own infringement claims in the same proceedings. The Galaxy Note 10.1 is Samsung’s latest self-branded tablet, though the manufacturer has been tapped to provide hardware for Google’s Nexus 10 slate as well. The Jelly Been update is the version of Google’s Android OS that powers the Note, thus its inclusion in this suit, which is slated currently for a 2014 trial date. Obviously we’re not looking at a draw down situation here, as both sides in the case seem eager to make sure device lists are updated to include the latest from each side. Apple won a preliminary order in this case blocking the sale of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus in the U.S., and added the Galaxy S III to the list of products it says are infringing its IP in August. In October, Judge Lucy Koh rescinded a previous injunction against the Galaxy Tab 10.1, an earlier 10-inch tablet from Samsung, in a separate proceeding in the same court. For any action resulting from these proceedings to have teeth, they really need to apply to current products, and given that the trial date isn’t for over a year yet, expect to see more devices named by both parties in the interim as additional hardware is released.</Content></Article>
