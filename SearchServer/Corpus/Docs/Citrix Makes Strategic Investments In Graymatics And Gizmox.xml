The company is backing Graymatics, a stealth startup that is building a cloud platform for content-based analysis of video and other digital media, and Gizmox, the developer of the Visual WebGui web, cloud and mobile delivery platform. The Graymatics investment marks the fourth funding commitment for the Citrix Startup Accelerator, the company’s Silicon Valley-based seed investment initiative, which launched in December 2010. The investment follows funding commitments made to Primadesk, a stealth mode company and Core Mobile Networks. The Gizmox investment is of greater strategic importance to Citrix. As part of the deal, the companies will work together on solutions to enable enterprises to deliver existing and new applications to the rapidly expanding set of HTML5-enabled devices. Gizmox’s VWG technology enables data-centric enterprise applications to run on HTML5 web, cloud and mobile platforms as rich applications without plug-ins. In 3 years, Gizmox says, its VWG software has been downloaded more than 1,000,000 times, and over 35,000 VWG applications are said to be already in production at organizations such as SAP, IBM, Visa, Thomson Reuters, Shell, Texas Instruments and Good Year.
