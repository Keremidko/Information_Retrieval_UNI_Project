After a few delays caused by last-second battery bugs, Google is now rolling out Android 5.0 (aka Lollipop) to many of its previously released Nexus devices. Starting today, users of the Nexus 4, 5, 7, and 10 should start seeing Lollipop hit their handsets. The not-so-good news: It’s rolling out in waves, and Google is being a bit vague about how long the rollout might take. They’ve been known to spread rollouts out by as much as three weeks in the past. In case you’ve missed it, Android 5.0 Lollipop brings all sorts of new tricks to the mix: a whole new look called “Material,” an on-the-fly guest user mode, a new app switcher, massive battery life enhancements, and a much improved notifications system. Check out our full review of Lollipop right over here. Annoyingly, popping into your device settings and pounding that “check for update” button won’t necessarily help with this one. Unless Google has given your individual device the green light, it’ll just say you’re already up-to-date. On the upside, Google has just released the factory images for the Nexus 5, 7 , 9 and 10 (note: no word on the Nexus 4 images yet) — so if you’re feeling a bit hacky and know your way around the Android SDK, you can skip the queue and flash to 5.0 yourself with these instructions. #AndroidLollipop rollout has started and will soon be available on most #Nexus devices.
