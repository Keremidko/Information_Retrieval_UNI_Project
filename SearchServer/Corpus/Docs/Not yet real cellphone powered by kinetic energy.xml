It’s only a render, a mock-up, and looks like something the Legion of Doom would use. (It also looks better than damn near everything that came out of Barcelona this week.)

Imagine that, missing an important call because you forgot to run a marathon with it in your pocket. An exaggeration, yes, but something to think about. Not that much thinking is required at all, being that the phone is just a fancy-looking render for us to gawk at. Kinetic Cell Phone [Yanko Design]</Content></Article>
