John Biggs and I will be discussing the latest in tech news, and then we’ll be joined by a surprise guest for an interview. During the second half of the show, we’ll fire up the TC Radio Pitch-Off, where five companies will have exactly 60 seconds to impress a guest VC judge, John, and myself. It’s the highlight of each week, and we sincerely hope that you join us. Oh, and if you want to participate in the pitch-off, check out the details below: Rules: 1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you. 2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome. 3. You must be able to pitch your product with your words only. 4. You must be able to operate a telephone. Apply: Apply here. It’s going to be a hoot!
