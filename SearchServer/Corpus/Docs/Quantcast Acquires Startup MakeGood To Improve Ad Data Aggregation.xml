Quantcast CEO Konrad Feldman said the company spent the last year looking for ways to improve the tools it offers for reconciliation, i.e., combining its own data with that from the customer’s system to get the big picture on an ad campaign’s effectiveness. In a blog post announcing the acquisition, he writes that one of the industry’s big challenges is “aggregating, organizing, and reconciling campaign data to form a ‘single view of truth’ in order to make critical decisions.” MakeGood offers particularly “elegant” technology in this vein, Feldman told me, and through the acquisition, Quantcast can improve its services in two ways – first, by “further automating all of the processes that we use in reconciliation,” and second by making its data reports more in-depth and “increasingly user-friendly.” It sounds like Quantcast customers won’t have to wait very long to see the improvements. The company will be adding more automation in the first quarter of 2013, Feldman said, with improved reporting (both from the MakeGood acquisition and developed by Quantcast) rolling out throughout the year. The financial terms of the deal aren’t being disclosed. CEO Jeff Coon and the rest of the MakeGood team will be joining Quantcast, and they plan to work with current MakeGood clients “to ensure data is transferred securely.” MakeGood was funded by friends and family.
