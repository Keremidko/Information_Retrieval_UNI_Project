MD Philip Macauley to lead the company’s operations and expansion into the UK market. Macauley spent ten years at Yahoo!, where he was most recently Director of Business Development and Commercial Relations. His tenor at the Internet giant saw him take on various “senior roles” including “driving media agency relationships as Agency Sales Director and leading the company’s publisher efforts as Head of Publisher Partnerships.” All of which would appear to make Macauley a very good fit for Quantcast. “Since the launch of our global audience service in March, we’ve seen strong worldwide growth, particularly in Europe,” says Konrad Feldman, co-founder and CEO Quantcast. “Phil has exceptional knowledge of the UK marketplace, the needs of buyers and sellers, and a deep understanding of the emergence of real-time media solutions and the value these technologies deliver to publishers, marketers and consumers. We’re delighted to have him spearheading our UK expansion and excited for the opportunity it presents.” Quantcast measures audiences on the web in real-time so that advertisers can better target their campaigns. The company’s services are used extensively by the advertising industry including media agencies, marketers and “millions” of websites worldwide, such as MTV Networks, Bloomberg, The Economist, Reuters, IAC, BBC, Time Inc., NBC Universal, Discovery Communications, TypePad, WordPress, Dailymotion, Demand Media and LinkedIn.
