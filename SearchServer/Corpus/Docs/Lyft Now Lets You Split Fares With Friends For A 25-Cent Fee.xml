At least for now, it just feels like Lyft does less dumb stuff that grosses me out. Lyft has just nabbed the one feature from Uber that I’ve sorely missed: fare splitting. While you’ve always been able to divvy up the cost of a ride with cash between friends after the fact (duh), there’s been no easy way to split up the ride cost within the Lyft app itself. Now there is! During a ride, open the ride options menu. Tap “Split payment.” Pick up to 5 friends. When they accept, the fare will be split automatically. Tada! Alas, there’s a 25 cent fee for each friend you bring in, presumably to cover bringing another credit card transaction fee into the mix. This fee isn’t unique to Lyft, though; Uber says they charge the same amount.</Content></Article>
