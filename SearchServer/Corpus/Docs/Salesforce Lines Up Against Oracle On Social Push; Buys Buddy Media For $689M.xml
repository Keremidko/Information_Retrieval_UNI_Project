The news comes just weeks after enterprise services rival Oracle announced it would buy another social media marketing player, Vitrue, for $300 million, and comes just days before Oracle is due to announce a new enterprise cloud computing strategy. That is due to happen on June 6, and to mark the occasion the company has pushed their outspoken and iconic CEO Larry Ellison on Twitter. (As yet, he’s been radio silent and will only officially start to tweet around the cloud announcement on June 6, Oracle’s twitter account says.) Some have questioned whether Salesforce has made full use of its acquisition of Radian6 for $326 million, so people will be watching closely to see how Buddy Media is run: will it be given free reign to continue its business as usual or will there be some attempts to integrate the business into a wider offering? It seems that Oracle, at least, is focused on integration, specifically on putting Vitrue into a wider, enterprise cloud offering with social as one part of a suite of services. In a recent interview, Abhay Parasnis, Oracle’s SVP of Cloud Development, said that Vitrue helps Oracle fulfil its “broad vision” in end-to-end cloud services, which includes not only marketing, but CRM and commerce services. Full release below. Salesforce.com Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Buddy Media Buddy Media, the world’s leading social media marketing platform, enables the world’s top brands and advertisers, including Ford, Hewlett Packard, L’Oreal and Mattel, to connect with more than a billion customers on Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube and more Combining market leaders Salesforce Radian6 and Buddy Media, the Salesforce Marketing Cloud immediately will become the platform of choice for brands to listen, engage, gain insight, publish, advertise and measure social marketing programs SAN FRANCISCO, June 4, 2012 /PRNewswire/ — Salesforce.com [NYSE: CRM], the enterprise cloud computing (http://www.salesforce.com/cloudcomputing/) company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Buddy Media, the world’s leading social media marketing platform, for approximately $689 million payable in cash and salesforce.com equity. The transaction is expected to be completed during salesforce.com‘s fiscal third quarter ending October 31, 2012, and is subject to customary closing conditions. Comments on the News “Salesforce.com now has the number one players in social listening and marketing – Radian6 and Buddy Media,” said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO, salesforce.com. “With CMOs surpassing CIOs in spend on technology within the next five years, our Marketing Cloud leadership will allow us to capitalize on this massive opportunity.” “Social media has caused the biggest transformation in marketing since the Mad Men era, causing CMOs to completely re-think their strategies,” said Marcel LeBrun, SVP of Salesforce Radian6. “By bringing together market leaders Radian6 and Buddy Media, we are doubling down on the Salesforce Marketing Cloud to provide CMOs with the ability to manage the entire social marketing lifecycle.” “Buddy Media’s mission is to eliminate the current state of anarchy in social marketing,” said Michael Lazerow, co-founder and CEO, Buddy Media. “With the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, marketers will be able to unify their efforts to better organize their teams, optimize their social programs and deliver real business results.” Buddy Media – The World’s Leading Social Media Marketing Platform Founded in 2007, Buddy Media started as an idea to empower chief marketing officers (CMOs) and agencies to organize their teams and optimize their social media marketing programs.

The Salesforce Marketing Cloud – Transforming Marketing for the Social Era The marketing industry is undergoing the biggest transformation it’s seen in 60 years, and it’s all being driven by the unprecedented growth of social networks. Today’s leading brands are looking to completely transform their traditional marketing strategies for the social era. Industry analysts predict that CMOs will surpass CIOs in spend on technology within the next five years(1) and that social advertising will be the largest growth area of online advertising by 2013(2). By combining Buddy Media, the world’s leading social media marketing platform, with Salesforce Radian6, the world’s leading social media listening platform, salesforce.com will deliver the first comprehensive Marketing Cloud that will allow customers to listen, engage, gain insight, publish, advertise and measure social marketing programs. With the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, CMOs will be empowered to manage the entire social marketing lifecycle. Financial Details of Proposed Buddy Media Acquisition Salesforce.com will acquire Buddy Media for approximately $467 million in cash and $184 million in salesforce.com common stock, and $38 million in vested salesforce.com options and restricted stock units.  All of Buddy Media’s vested and unvested options, restricted stock and restricted stock units held by continuing employees will be assumed and converted into options, restricted stock and restricted stock units of salesforce.com. The acquisition has been approved by Buddy Media’s board of directors and stockholders and is expected to close during the third quarter of salesforce.com‘s fiscal 2013, ending October 31, 2012, subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Additional details and information about the terms and conditions of the acquisition will be available in a current report on Form 8-K to be filed by salesforce.com with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Financial Impact of Proposed Buddy Media Acquisition Q2 FY13:  Given an expected fiscal third quarter close date, this transaction is not expected to have any material impact to salesforce.com‘s fiscal second quarter FY13 revenue or EPS results, previously guided on May 17, 2012. Q3 FY13:  Salesforce.com expects to provide revenue and EPS guidance for its fiscal third quarter FY13, including the effects of this transaction, when it announces results for its second fiscal quarter, ended July 31, 2012. FY13: The acquisition is expected to increase revenues by approximately $20 million to $25 million, and to reduce non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.14 to $0.15 in the second half of the year ending January 31, 2013 depending on the final acquisition date. To reflect the impact of this acquisition, the company is updating the full-year guidance it provided on May 17, 2012. Specifically, the company now expects FY13 revenue in the range of approximately $2.990 billion to $3.025 billion, and FY13 non-GAAP EPS in the range of approximately $1.45 to $1.49. Non-GAAP EPS excludes the impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles from acquisitions, and the amortization of debt discount on the company’s convertible senior notes, as well as the tax consequences associated with these items. The financial impact of the acquisition on a GAAP basis cannot be estimated until the allocation of the purchase price is completed following the closing of the acquisition. However, salesforce.com currently expects that the dilutive impact of the acquisition to EPS will be significantly greater on a GAAP basis than a non-GAAP basis.
