This was the tablet that through the magic of subsidies — and outsourced Chinese labor — was going to rain from the mana from the heavens and cover all of India with affordable touchscreen computing. Yeah, that’s not going to happen anytime soon. According to The Times Of India, the project just lost HCL Infosystems as its primary contractor. This presumably means the project will then shop around for another vender, which will then lead to a new round of contract talks, negotiations, and whatnot. Basically, don’t expect this thing anytime soon. In the mean time, India-based Notion Ink just started shipping their Indian-designed, Chinese-made tablet although this version is slightly more than $35.
