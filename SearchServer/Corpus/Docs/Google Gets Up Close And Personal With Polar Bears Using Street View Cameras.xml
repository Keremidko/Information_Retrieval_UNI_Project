Now it’s going there again with stunning Street View pictures of polar bears in their natural habitat, just in time for International Polar Bear Day today. Shot in Churchill, Manitoba – apparently ‘the Polar Bear Capital of the World’ – and collaborating with Polar Bears International, Google mounted the Street View Trekker camera on a ‘Tundra Buggy’ and took Google Maps onto Canada’s tundra to collect 360 degree Street View imagery of polar bears on the tundra – their natural habitat. But there’s also a serious side. Bringing Street View to Canada’s tundra establishes what they say is a “baseline record of imagery” associated with specific geospatial data. That’s the kind of data that can later protect this amazing creature. Pretty cool stuff if we do say so ourselves.</Content></Article>
