Even some of the product managers driving the open strategy are not sticking around. We have learned that Amit Kumar, the director of product management behind Yahooâ€™s Search Monkey and semantic Web initiatives, is leaving by the end of the week. He will be joining semantic Web startup Dapper as Vice President of product management. The exodus continues. CrunchBase Information Yahoo!
