The Crunchies will be held on February 5, but we are about to close voting and we are also about to raise ticket prices by 15% so please act now. Read on to learn more. The Crunchies is the defining event for startups in SV and beyond. It celebrates the ingenuity, excitement, and energy of countless creators and makers and it allows us to take a breath, look around, and celebrate what we’re all doing. We’ll also welcome Silicon Valley’s hilarious T.J. Miller who will be there to help us highlight all the best startups, founders, apps, and technologies over the past year, and probably make fun of those who don’t end up winning. Tickets are still available and start at $90. We’ll be raising prices tomorrow so if you’re on the fence, buy today. The evening is a blast and the after-party is amazing. Dress up and come out and rage with us on February 5th. We want to see you there. But first, spend five minutes and cast your vote.
