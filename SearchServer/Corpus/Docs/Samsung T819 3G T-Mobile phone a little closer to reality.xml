While no exact release date is given, we have the vague “January” time frame now, which is in line with what we’ve been hearing. It’s tight mid-range package, with a passable 1.3-Megapixel camera, stereo Bluetooth, full IM client, myFaves, and many other basic features. And while the leaked doc says nothing about it’s 3G status, we know about it from the earlier link. So does this phone act as a harbinger of 3G networks yet to come? We have no idea, as T-Mo is mum on its plans, but we do know one thing: if it doesn’t kickoff it’s 3G network damn soon, they’re going to wind up an also-ran.
