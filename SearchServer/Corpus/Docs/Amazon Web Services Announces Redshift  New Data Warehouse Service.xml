Amazon claims that Redshift will increase the speed of query performance when analyzing any size data set, using the same SQL-based business intelligence tools they use today. Amazon Redshift includes technology components licensed from ParAccel and is available with two underlying node types, including either 2 terabytes or 16 terabytes of compressed customer data per node. Customers can start with a few hundred gigabytes and scale to a petabyte or more. Redshift pricing will start at 85 cents per hour. The service is available on-demand or as reserved instances. A three-year reserved instance is less than 23 cents per hour. In comparison, Jassy said a traditional data warehouse solution will cost $19,000 to $25,000 per terabyte.With Redshift the cost is $1,000 per terabyte per year. Business intelligence providers that will partner with AWS include MicroStrategies, Jaspersoft and Cognos.</Content></Article>
