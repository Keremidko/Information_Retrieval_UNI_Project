Saddle up and roll ‘em out because the Pi-Top Raspberry Pi laptop is ready to ride! We last met this laptop when it was still a gleam in a group of students’ eye. Now it’s a fully operational crowdfunding project and they’re looking for $80,000 to begin shipping the devices. The kit itself costs $249 with a motherboard or $200 without. You can also simply print your own case and parts and stick your own hardware into it, but where’s the fun in that? The kit should ship in May 2015 and we’ll be looking at it live in London next week at Disrupt. It’s a cute, clever little project and could be a good first computer or education machine for those looking for something inexpensive, powerful, and unique.</Content></Article>
