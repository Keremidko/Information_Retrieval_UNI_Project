That number is about to get a significant boost, with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donating $500,000. John and Ann Doerr are also pitching in $500K, and Code.org has also informed TechCrunch that serial entrepreneur Rich Barton is making a donation of $25K. Code.org gave itself plenty of time to reach its goal — the IndieGogo campaign ends December 14. With 47 days left, it’s now well past the $1 million mark and that’s before matching donations come in from Bill Gates and Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Salesforce, Google, and others. Code.org says that if it hits the $5 million mark, it can expand the Hour of Code to reach 100 million students. That seems like an awfully lofty goal, especially considering the non-profit says the campaign would help train approximately 10,000 teachers, but considering the lack of exposure most students get to computer science in K-12 schools, even a partial win would be impressive.
