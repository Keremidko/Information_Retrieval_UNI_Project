As CloudFlare founder and CEO Matthew Prince explains in today’s announcement, one of the challenges the company faces is to ensure that its network can’t be used to more efficiently distribute malware. “While CloudFlare is good at stopping new infections,” he writes, “we needed a way to ensure that sites weren’t already infected when they first signed up.” After looking at the available malware-scanning tools, CloudFlare set its sights on StopTheHacker. StopTheHacker raised a Series A round from Runa Capital and former Bluecoat chief executive Brian NeSmith back in 2012, but as far as we can see, it hasn’t raised any funding since. The service launched in 2008 and seems to have built a successful business model around selling its anti-malware services to small businesses and enterprises. It’s also been available in the CloudFlare Apps Marketplace for the last two years. The service helps companies protect their sites, but also offers an app for protecting Facebook profiles and website reputation management tools. Basic plans start at $96 per year. Prince notes that other large Internet firms have also invested in their anti-malware efforts, with Google acquiring VirusTotal back in 2012 and Twitter scooping up Dasient. For the time being, StopTheHacker will continue to operate as usual. “We will continue to operate the StopTheHacker service and invest in its continued innovation,” Prince writes. He expects the integration between the two services will allow the company to ” provide immediate remediation of malware and vulnerabilities in ways that were not previously possible.” The financial details of the transactions were not disclosed.</Content></Article>
