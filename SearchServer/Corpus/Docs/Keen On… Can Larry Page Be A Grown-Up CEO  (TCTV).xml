Edward’s six year stint in Mountain View has been recorded in his highly readable new book I’m Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee #59 where he reveals what life was really like at the plex in those early years. Earlier this week, TechcrunchTV got lucky when Edwards came into our San Francisco studio to tell me what he really thinks about Google. He didn’t disappoint – confessing why Eric Schmidt is the “Joe Biden of tech”, why the “Don’t Be Evil” slogan could only hurt Google and why Larry Page can be a grown-up CEO. This is the second in a two part interview with Douglas Edwards. Yesterday, Edwards confessed his early experiences at Google, including his memorable first job interview with Sergey Brin.
