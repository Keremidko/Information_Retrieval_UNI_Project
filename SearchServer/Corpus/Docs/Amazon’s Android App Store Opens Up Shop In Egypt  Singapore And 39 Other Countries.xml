This morning, Amazon is rolling out their App Store in 41 new places, bumping the grand total up to 236 countries and territories. At this point, it’s getting tough to think of a region where Amazon’s App Store isn’t up and running. Today’s expansions are focused on Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

If your app goes against a region’s laws or local restrictions, Amazon won’t allow it to be published there. It seems Amazon is mostly counting on developers to declare what their apps contain — but if a government comes knocking with a takedown request for a specific app, I wouldn’t expect Amazon to put up much of a fight.
