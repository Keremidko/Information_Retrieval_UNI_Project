But it doesn’t (thanks Apple!). Enter the Brunton Power Knife. It’s a Swiss Army Knife for the smartphone age with a cable connector for just about every situation. Packed inside the pocketable package is a standard USB plug that supplies power to microUSB and an Apple Lightning and 30 Dock Connector. Sadly, the full size USB plug only transmits power and not data so the Power Knife might not be for everyone. At $24.99, the Power Knife is fairly priced and a good addition to most bags. If you’re anything like me, you carry all three of these cables anyway. Throw those out and pack this svelte solution instead.</Content></Article>
