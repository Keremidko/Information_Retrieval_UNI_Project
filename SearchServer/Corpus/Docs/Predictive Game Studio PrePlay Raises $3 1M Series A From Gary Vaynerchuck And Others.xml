The company says it will use the funding to expand its staff and develop new apps for baseball and “other entertainment related content.” The funding round was led by social media entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, RSE Ventures’ CEO Matt Higgins, and other angel investors, whose names have not yet been released. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Users compete in social games on PrePlay to predict the outcomes of live TV shows. The company, formed in April 2010, currently has two titles: PrePlay Football and Molson Canadian NHL PrePlay, which was licensed by the NHL and (obviously) sponsored by Molson. As founder and CEO Andrew Daines said, the games are based on ” the most interesting question in the world–what’s going to happen next.” “This funding will allow us to continue to add to our rock star team and release titles for a greater variety of sports, media and entertainment content in the not-so-distant future,” Daines said in a press release. PrePlay’s blog touts impressive statistics from fan usage during the NHL Stanley Cup Finals. Posting 187,508 real time predictions throughout the playoffs, users attempted to predict who would win games and series and which players would be score clutch goals. However, they do not limit themselves to sports, as their site says they can expand their platform to other shows. PrePlay representatives were not immediately available for comment.</Content></Article>
