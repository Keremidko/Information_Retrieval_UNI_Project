After a short preview period that mostly allowed developers to push notifications to Android Wear smartwatches, the full SDK will now allow developers to create their own custom apps. This means they will be able to write their own custom user interfaces. The company demoed an app from Eat24, for example, which would allow you to order a pizza from the watch within 30 seconds and just a few taps. With the SDK, developers will also be able to get access to sensors and tap into voice actions. As Google noted during the keynote today, voice recognition is one of the main interfaces for all of its platforms. In addition, the SDK will allow developers to send data back and forth between a phone or tablet and the watch.
