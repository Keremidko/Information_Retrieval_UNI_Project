Kaufmann Mercantile is an online retailer that focuses on the curation of luxury, high-quality products. You could think of it a bit like Fab.com, but with a focus on luxury products as opposed to funky design. Kaufmann Mercantile sells everything from accessories to beauty products to home furnishings to workman’s tools, however the company isn’t ultra-focused on the super crowded clothing space. Of course, Kaufmann Mercantile does sell scarves, hats, gloves, and some house shoes, but I wouldn’t consider KM to be yet another online store for clothing. All that said, KM will be working on their own clothing label while continuing to build out the other product categories. So what will you find on Kaufmann Mercantile? You could browse this $200 shaving kit, or this $500 hatchet, or even this very special $250 thermal carafe. The possibilities are endless. Kaufmann Mercantile has been around since 2009 and has sold over $6 million worth of merchandise, coming out to around 180,000 products sold. According to the company, they’ve worked to get “over 300 of the world’s best manufacturers from more than 20 countries across the globe.” You can learn more about Kaufmann Mercantile here.</Content></Article>
