The post says the funding comes from DFJ Growth and Capital Group’s SMALLCAP World Fund, and that DFJ’s Barry Schuler (former CEO of AOL, which owns TechCrunch) is joining the Foursquare board. CEO Dennis Crowley writes, “This investment means that we can build our vision even faster. And that you guys are going to see a lot more from our team.” The post also states that Foursquare now has 45 million registered users (with 40 million tips and 5 billion check ins) but it doesn’t say how many of them are active. Back in April, Foursquare raised $41 million in a debt deal (this new round is equity, presumably). At the time, the company said it had 33 million registered users.</Content></Article>
