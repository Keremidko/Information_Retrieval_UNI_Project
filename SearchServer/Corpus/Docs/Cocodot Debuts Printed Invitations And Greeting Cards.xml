Founded by former MySpace CMO Shawn Gold, Cocodot aims to be a one-stop-shop for event planning and invitations; sort of a modern, more chic Evite. You can create a high resolution, chic, stylish invitation (that can be printed as well), a vertical event pages, guest management tools, seating charts, and a directory for event planning vendors. The new printing feature aims to give you the best of both worlds when it comes to sending tangible invitations and more eco-friendly online invites. Cocodot will allow you to print cards and also include an interactive digital version for friends and family to share comments. Brides can also coordinate matching digital and printed stationary from the engagement announcement to the wedding invitation. Cocodot, which has raised $3 million in funding, has also recently launched design collections with a number of fashion houses, including DKNY and Lilly Pulitzer. Cocodot faces competition from Pingg, Punchbowl, and others.</Content></Article>
