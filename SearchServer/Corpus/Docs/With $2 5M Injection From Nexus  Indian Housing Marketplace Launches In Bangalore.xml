The company, which operates similarly to Trulia and Zillow, provides a real estate search site which displays a visual map of available housing for rent or sale. The search results are filtered by how many rooms are available per property, and there are photos for each listing as well. Housing.co.in just received $2.5 million from Nexus Venture Partners from the latter’s newly-raised, India-focused fund of $270 million. Co-founder Advitiya Sharma said the team plans to use its new funding to expand its data science teams. The eventual goal is for its teams to use the housing data collected to display new metrics like area-based pricing, listing decay rates and ratings on neighborhoods, to name some. This round of financing is its fourth in the past year since its birth. The company has never canvassed for funding since it was started in June 2012, Sharma said. Besides Bangalore and Mumbai, the site also serves Gurgaon, Pune and Hyderabad. In spite of its age, Housing.co.in has already crossed 200 employees. The tech team is just 13 people-strong, however, but it will add 21 more engineers from the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) within the month. These will add to about 30 IIT-educated engineers already employed, said Sharma.</Content></Article>
