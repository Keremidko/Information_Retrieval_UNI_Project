According to Marshall Kirkpatrick at Splashcast, the film is a “model of new media in action” and will be available on YouTube for one week. I haven’t had the chance to sit through all 71:54 minutes of the film yet, but if Marshall raves about it then it’s probably worth watching. Notably it’s surprising that it has taken this long for full length features to hit YouTube given that they’ve been available on Google Video since day one.
