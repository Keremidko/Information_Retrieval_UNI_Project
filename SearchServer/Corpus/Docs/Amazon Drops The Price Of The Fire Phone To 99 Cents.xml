Before you head over to Amazon with nothing but a lone Washington in hand, remember: it’s 99 cents with a 2-year contract, and it’s only available on AT&amp;T. At AT&amp;T’s current cheapest monthly rate ($60), that $1 phone really ends up costing you closer to $1,441. Without the service plan, the 32GB Fire Phone still costs $449. If you’re willing to ignore that a new iPhone is almost certainly being announced tomorrow, or that preeetty much any Android phone on the market would probably be a better pick in the long run, you can find the deeply discounted Fire Phone here</Content></Article>
