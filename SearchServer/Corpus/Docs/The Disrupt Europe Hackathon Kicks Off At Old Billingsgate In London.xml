Participants are now gathered in The Vault, the venue’s ominously-named underground area — but earlier, when everyone was still waiting for the doors to open, Mike Butcher and I walked the line and talked to a few of the attendees about why they’d came and what they’re planning to build. There were some cool ideas (not to mention a few highly secretive teams), but the best part was hearing how many people were coming to Disrupt for the first time, or to their first hackathon ever. Teams will have a little less than 24 hours to complete their projects. On Sunday, they’ll be presenting the results on-stage and competing for prizes from TechCrunch and the various event sponsors. Tickets to Disrupt Europe are still available and can be purchased here.</Content></Article>
