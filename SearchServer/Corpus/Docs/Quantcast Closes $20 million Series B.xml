Quantcast offers a “new media measurement service” that competes with companies such as comScore, HitWise and Alexa. Quantcast combines directly measured audience data with panel-based estimates to deliver third-party metrics on websites for advertisers or others seeking traffic data. Participants in Quantcast’s direct measurement program include Fox, CBS, Belo Corporation, AccuWeather, Slide, and IDG. As part of the deal Ken Howery of Founders Fund and Mike Hirshland of Polaris Venture Partners will join Quantcast’s Board of Directors.
