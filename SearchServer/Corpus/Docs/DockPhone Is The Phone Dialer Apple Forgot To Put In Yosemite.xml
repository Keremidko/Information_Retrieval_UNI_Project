Taking a call is magic but dialing a number is a pain. Enter DockPhone. The $.99 app fixes Yosemite. This little OS X app is simply a phone dialer. Type a name or number into the dialog box and the app calls up Facetime in the background, connects to your iPhone and dials the number. It’s exactly what’s missing from Yosemite. Right now, without DockPhone, a person has to navigate FaceTime to place a call from within OS X. This turns on your webcam and calls up a UI that’s not designed for such a mundane task. DockPhone gets the job done without any fuss. Best of all, the app features impressive dictation. You don’t have to type the name. Just click the mic button and speak the name of the person you want to call. The app does the rest of the work. DockPhone costs just $.99 on the App Store. It’s a steal at that price even if you only dial from your Mac once a month. Because, you see, after you use the app just once, you’ll never dial from your iPhone again.</Content></Article>
