The Charge HR retails for $150 while the Surge smartwatch commands $250. These are the models to carry Fitbit into 2015 and beyond. The company carved out a dominant place in the fitness market despite suffering a major recall in early 2014. The Charge HR builds on the success (and failure) of the Fitbit Force but adds heartrate monitoring capability. The Surge is a big addition for Fitbit. It’s more smartwatch than activity tracker and is clearly designed to appeal to fitness fanatics. The Surge also has a heart-rate monitor and built-in GPS capabilities that can track pace, distance, and elevation. The watch’s large LCD face is customizable and can display Caller ID, text alerts and media playback. But at $249, Fitbit is competing with a different set of players including Samsung and Garmin. While Fitbit might rule the inexpensive activity tracker field, the brand could face hesitation from buyers looking for a premium product. The two fitness trackers are now available on Fitbit.com and will hit retailers in the coming weeks with international shipping expected in early February.</Content></Article>
