Over the course of the last few years, the seed-stage investment firm has made numerous bets on e-commerce companies. Today, it’s brought together a lineup of speakers to help its portfolio companies and other entrepreneurs in the Valley to better understand how e-commerce works. At its Commercism conference, 500 Startups has assembled a number of speakers to share their experiences around selling online and on mobile. With a lineup that includes Bonobos co-founder Andy Dunn, Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison, Braintree CEO Bill Ready, ModCloth co-founder Eric Koger, Wanelo founder Deena Varshavskaya, Polyvore co-founder Jess Lee, and Andreessen Horowitz partner Jeff Jordan, knowledge is bound to be dropped. You can no longer get tickets to the sold-out event, but you can still watch along with the crowd on the live stream above. An agenda for all those great speakers can be found here.</Content></Article>
