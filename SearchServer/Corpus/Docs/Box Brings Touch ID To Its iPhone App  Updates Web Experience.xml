On the iOS side, Box is bringing Touch ID support to iPhones that can support the tool, allowing users to unlock documents with their finger instead of a potentially ponderous PIN. The new app will also allow users to place Box content into their Notification Center for quicker access. On the web side of things, Box has revamped parts of its appearance. The company simplified the header and dropped some clutter. The company also brought “Favorites” to the web, to match its mobile applications, and revamped how it displays notifications to be simpler, and easier to use. The updates come on the heels of Microsoft recently releasing a typhoon of updates to its own productivity applications on iOS and other platforms. Box is still in a holding pattern for its IPO, but since the company topped up its cash reserves to more than $200 million earlier this year, it has runway into the new year.</Content></Article>
