Yesterday, we learned that Gowalla co-founder Josh Williams and Van Damme were leaving Facebook in unrelated departures. Today, Van Damme posted on his personal blog, “Hello, Dropbox”: “The past 18 months were some of the best of my life, both personally and professionally. I’ve had the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds in this business, on an app that transformed the way people interact with each other every single day, and also made a lot of new friends… Dropbox is a fascinating company. It provides value to a wide range of people, not just those who build things.” Van Damme has been the lead mobile designer for Instagram since January 2012; before that, he was a designer at Gowalla, a Foursquare competitor that was acquired by Facebook after Van Damme left. Friday will be Van Damme’s last day at Instagram; he will take some time off to relax before joining the Dropbox team in early August. Pic via. Van Damme is on the left</Content></Article>
