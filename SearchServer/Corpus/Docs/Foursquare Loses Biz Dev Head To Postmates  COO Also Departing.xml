The departures come amidst major changes for the company. The Foursquare app split in two and spun out with new app Swarm earlier this month. Foursquare’s CEO Dennis Crowley told Isaac the two departures were merely coincidental. He maintained that Foursquare was doing “just fine.” Cohen, who has been with the company for 4.5 years now, says he’s leaving for personal reasons. As he told Isaac: “I was running low on gas, frankly, and it made sense for me to hand the baton off to a fresh new executive.” Foursquare confirmed to TechCrunch in an email that they’ve appointed Jeff Glueck, a former Travelocity CMO and former CEO at Skyfire to replace Cohen. Mike Harkey, a current Foursquare biz dev team member, will be stepping in for Leudorf. “We couldn’t be more excited about Jeff and Mike’s new roles, and the continued momentum of Foursquare,” said a spokesperson. “Evan and Holger have been instrumental in growing Foursquare from a small shop to a company employing more than 170 people worldwide – without them we wouldn’t be where we are today. Luedorf, meanwhile, will be joining the still young food delivery startup Postmates.  Foursquare says they are excited for Glueck and Harkey’s new roles. According to the company, they conducted an extensive, six month search process before deciding on the two.    </Content></Article>
