Our camera connects to the pack via a HDMI connector cable. But at the end of our evening Showstoppers coverage, the HDMI plug snapped and broke. At 10pm in Las Vegas, how do you find a replacement HDMI plug? Actually, of all the places in the world to have this happen, we were in the right place. John Biggs suggested we look around the exhibit hall. So, I spied a large monitor at one of the booths that was using a HDMI cable. I offered to buy it from the exhibitor after the event. They suggested an even better solution. The exhibitor at the booth next to them was Perfect Path. They were showing what they claim was the industry’s first Locking HDMI Connector. The company says their patented plug has four times the holding retention of our regular HDMI connector. They happily provided us one for free. And the locking feature really does make make the connection much more solid. If you pull lightly on the cable, it won’t come out. Problem solved. Thanks guys.</Content></Article>
