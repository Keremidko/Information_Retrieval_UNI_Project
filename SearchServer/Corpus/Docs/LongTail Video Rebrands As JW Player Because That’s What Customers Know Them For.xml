But, as it turns out, tons of customers know the JW Player, which they’ve been building and distributing over the last five years or so. The rebrand will take advantage of branding behind the JW Player, which is used to deliver video on more than 2 million sites worldwide, including a number of media companies and small businesses. But it will continue to focus on multiple products, not just the video player. That includes its video management software, which was formerly called Bits On The Run. That product will be rebranded as the JW Platform. It’s also continue to add other features to the player, including expanding its availability on HTML5-compliant mobile browsers, as well as growing its video advertising capabilities.</Content></Article>
