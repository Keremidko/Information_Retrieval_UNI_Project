As expected, the company is aligning its strategy with Microsoft. By now, you’ve probably seen the ‘burning platform’ memo penned by the fresh CEO of the world’s largest mobile phone manufacturer, former Microsoft executive Stephen Elop (the existence of the brutally honest memo was first reported by TechCrunch Europe and later published in full by Engadget). In it, Elop addressed the company’s formidable competitors (Apple and Google with its Android OS strategy), who are consistently out-innovating Nokia and steadily taking over its market share. Clearly, Elop was gearing up for the announcement of some significant changes with regards to Nokia’s strategy going forward. He delivered. (full press release below) Here’s the meat: - Plans for a broad strategic partnership with Microsoft to build a new global mobile ecosystem; Windows Phone would serve as Nokia’s primary smartphone platform. – A renewed approach to capture volume and value growth to connect “the next billion” to the Internet in developing growth markets – Focused investments in next-generation disruptive technologies – A new leadership team and organizational structure with a clear focus on speed, results and accountability Windows Phone to become Nokia’s primary smartphone platform = huge. Microsoft reportedly offered Nokia hundreds of millions of dollars to make that switch. Nokia will use Bing for search functionality across its devices, while Nokia Maps will become core to Microsoft’s mapping services. Nokia’s content and app store will be integrated with Microsoft’s Marketplace. More info about the partnership is available here. Nokia says Symbian will become a ‘franchise platform’, while MeeGo will become an open-source, mobile operating system project. In their words: “MeeGo will place increased emphasis on longer-term market exploration of next-generation devices, platforms and user experiences”. Nokia still plans to ship a MeeGo-related product later this year. The biggest change to the management team: Alberto Torres has apparently stepped down, effective February 10, to “pursue other interests outside the company”. Torres joined Nokia in 2004 and was EVP of MeeGo Computers, Mobile Solutions. As of April 1, Nokia will also boast a new company structure, which features two distinct business units: Smart Devices and Mobile Phones. You can learn more about what that means in the press release below, which will no doubt be ripped apart by press and analysts in the following hours and days (and beyond). When the company recently reported its fourth-quarter earnings, Nokia said its estimated market share had shrunk to 31 percent. With this broad partnership with Microsoft and the organizational overhaul, is a veritable comeback in the cards for the ailing mobile phone maker? Nokia outlines new strategy, introduces new leadership, operational structure London, UK – Nokia today outlined its new strategic direction, including changes in leadership and operational structure to accelerate the company’s speed of execution in a dynamic competitive environment. Major elements of the new strategy include: – Plans for a broad strategic partnership with Microsoft to build a new global mobile ecosystem; Windows Phone would serve as Nokia’s primary smartphone platform. – A renewed approach to capture volume and value growth to connect “the next billion” to the Internet in developing growth markets – Focused investments in next-generation disruptive technologies – A new leadership team and organizational structure with a clear focus on speed, results and accountability “Nokia is at a critical juncture, where significant change is necessary and inevitable in our journey forward,” said Stephen Elop, Nokia President and CEO. “Today, we are accelerating that change through a new path, aimed at regaining our smartphone leadership, reinforcing our mobile device platform and realizing our investments in the future.” Nokia plans to form a strategic partnership with Microsoft to build a global mobile ecosystem based on highly complementary assets. The Nokia-Microsoft ecosystem targets to deliver differentiated and innovative products and have unrivalled scale, product breadth, geographical reach, and brand identity. With Windows Phone as its primary smartphone platform, Nokia would help drive the future of the platform by leveraging its expertise on hardware optimization, software customization, language support and scale. Nokia and Microsoft would also combine services assets to drive innovation. Nokia Maps, for example, would be at the heart of key Microsoft assets like Bing and AdCenter, and Nokia’s application and content store would be integrated into Microsoft Marketplace. Under the proposed partnership, Microsoft would provide developer tools, making it easier for application developers to leverage Nokia’s global scale. With Nokia’s planned move to Windows Phone as its primary smartphone platform, Symbian becomes a franchise platform, leveraging previous investments to harvest additional value. This strategy recognizes the opportunity to retain and transition the installed base of 200 million Symbian owners. Nokia expects to sell approximately 150 million more Symbian devices in the years to come. Under the new strategy, MeeGo becomes an open-source, mobile operating system project. MeeGo will place increased emphasis on longer-term market exploration of next-generation devices, platforms and user experiences. Nokia still plans to ship a MeeGo-related product later this year. In feature phones, Nokia unveiled a renewed strategy to leverage its innovation and strength in growth markets to connect the next billion people to their first Internet and application experience.
