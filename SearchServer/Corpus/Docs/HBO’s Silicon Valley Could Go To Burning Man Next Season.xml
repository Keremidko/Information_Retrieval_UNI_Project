We hear the HBO Silicon Valley creator may be going to do some research on what many believe is an essential experience for Silicon Valley insiders. One of those insiders is Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who derided Judge at the premiere of the HBO show, saying he’d never been to Burning Man and therefore didn’t really ‘get’ the real Silicon Valley. At the premier, Re/code quoted Musk as saying, “If you haven’t been, you just don’t get it. You could take the craziest L.A. party and multiply it by a thousand, and it doesn’t even get fucking close to what’s in Silicon Valley. The show didn’t have any of that.” We hear Musk will not be attending this year. However, Judge might be among the technorati attending the annual festival in the desert now. What Musk said about the show could be the inspiration for a possible Silicon Valley episode as well. After winning TechCrunch’s Disrupt Battlefield, Pied Piper is probably ready to raise its Series A Round. That’s a process that could lead the founders to the playa, which is increasingly becoming a place where deals like that get done. Burning Man is now rife with tech billionaires and young startups alike. There have been reports of actual business meetings (clothing optional?) being conducted out in the desert in year’s past. Here’s to hoping Dinesh Chugtai gets his freak on in a cloud of playa dust this next season. Featured Image: Jon Collier/Flickr</Content></Article>
