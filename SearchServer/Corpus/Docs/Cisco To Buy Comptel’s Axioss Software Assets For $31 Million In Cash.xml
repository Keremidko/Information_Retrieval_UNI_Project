Axioss is a fulfillment solution developed by Axiom Systems, a company that Comptel acquired back in 2008. With the acquisition, Cisco hopes to extend network and service management technologies across its IP-based network platforms and enable service providers to more quickly launch new video, data, mobility and cloud services to their customers, using a single management architecture. The AXIOSS software suite will also enhance Cisco Prime, which enables service providers to better manage their networks and network services, the company says. Upon the close of the acquisition, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of calendar year 2011, the AXIOSS team will be integrated into the Cisco NMTG and Cisco Advanced Services Group. Gareth Senior, Comptel CTO and member of its Executive Board, will also be transferring to Cisco. Comptel and Cisco will continue their cooperation across other areas of OSS/BSS, e.g. cloud mediation and charging. Comptel says it will continue in fulfilment business developing and selling its Comptel Fulfillment Solution, retain its existing Axioss customer relationships and continue to support these customers.</Content></Article>
