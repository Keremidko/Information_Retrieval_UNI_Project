That’s because A) I was content with the way iOS handled upscaling lower-resolution apps, and B) I was primarily spending time in first-party software. But using Gmail on both devices via the native app over a longer period of time has proved trying. Today, Google remedied the situation with an update that brings full iPhone 6 and 6 Plus resolution compatibility to their iOS app. Long story short, installing the update if you have either of Apple’s latest smartphones is like getting glasses for the first time and never realizing you couldn’t properly see before. You can now see a huge portion of your inbox via email previews, and opening individual emails reveals body text that will make you feel almost spoiled. Slowly but surely, most popular third-party apps are getting their iPhone 6 makeover. Facebook: You’re up next.</Content></Article>
