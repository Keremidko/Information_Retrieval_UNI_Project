Ek responded by noting that Spotify has a site for artists that allows for “transparency” in the process and, after prompting from the panel moderator, pointed out that Spotify paid out $1 billion to “the music industry” last year. Neither Buffett nor the audience seemed particularly satisfied by the response. Featured Image: gaët/Flickr UNDER A cc by-nd 2.0 LICENSE</Content></Article>
