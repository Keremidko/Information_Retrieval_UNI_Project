Flux’s team took to Kickstarter to generate interest in the project, and generate interest they did: The project has raised over $1.3 million, with five days yet to go, after seeking just $100,000 as their starting goal. Flux hitting that threshold is more impressive in the new era of Kickstarter, where there’s less oversight and a more “anything-goes” attitude to projects. Passing the $1 million mark is also impressive given that 3D printing is still largely a niche market, despite some suggestion with Makerbot and its ilk that we were on the verge of a new era of mass market adoption. The project has introduced a number of stretch goals to help encourage further backers, and real-time monitoring via a camera built into the array that houses a scanner designed to provide the printer with feedback on the printing process is the only one left unattained at the $1.5 million mark, and there’s still a chance it could meet that target in the time remaining, given the second batch of Flux pre-orders still has some units available.

As you can see, Flux at least has working prototypes that do what they claim production units will be able to, and that’s more than a lot of crowdfunded projects can say these days. A modular printer that goes beyond simply swapping out printing heads still presents a lot of engineering challenges, especially when you’re letting the community build its own swappable components, so we’ll be watching closely to see how well they meet expectations.</Content></Article>
