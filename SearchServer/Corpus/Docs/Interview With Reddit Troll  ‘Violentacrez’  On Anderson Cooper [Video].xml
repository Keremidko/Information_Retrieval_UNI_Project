After being outed by Gawker last week, the 49-year-old softspoken software engineer has lost his job and rekindled a fierce debate over the limits of free speech. “I am to some degree apologizing for what I did,” said Michael Brutsch, “Violentacrez is what I did in my spare time to unwind from my 10-hour-a-day job. That’s how I relaxed in the evening. I no longer need to relax in the evening, because I no longer have a job.” Brutsch came to notoriety by posting racist and misogynistic photos to the popular content aggregator, Reddit, including one forum of underage girls, dubbed “jailbait”. He was the creator and main contributor to some of Reddit’s most disgusting subreddits including, but definitely not limited to: /r/chokeabitch, /r/rapebait, /r/hitler, /r/jewmeric, and /r/incest. Despite the outcry against trolls like Brutsch, Reddit defends the strict free speech policies of the user-generated portions of the site (“subreddits”). “We stand for free speech … We are not going to ban distasteful subreddits,” said CEO Yishan Wong.</Content></Article>
