Valve has pushed the Steam Machines’ novel controller release from 2014 to 2015. Essentially, it will be released when Steam thinks its ready and not a minute before. Smart. Hardware rarely recovers from a rocky launch. The minimum viable product has to be free of bugs and full of enjoyment — especially from an unknown hardware maker like Valve. The Steam Machines next-gen controller needs to be awesome from launch day. The word came from a blog post detailing the Machine’s controller development, which also reports “everyone from industry professionals to die-hard gamers to casual gamers” are testing the system with wireless controllers. Progression to live testing is a good sign. Valve itself is focusing on the controller rather than the actual gaming systems. Besides a building prototype reference system, that task was outsourced to trusted PC makers such as Dell’s Alienware, Asus and several others. Unlike traditional gaming PCs, Valve’s in-house SteamOS will power the boxes, giving them a console-like user experience free of the pains of a normal desktop OS. These systems from 3rd parties could be released prior to the Steam Controller, but without a halo product like the innovative controller, the launch would be rather lackluster. Of course gamers shouldn’t have expected anything less. Valve doesn’t launch; it delays.</Content></Article>
