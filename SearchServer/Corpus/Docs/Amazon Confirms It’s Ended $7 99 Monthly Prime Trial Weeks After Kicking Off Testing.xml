The yearly cost of Prime is $79, so the monthly option gave consumers a way of spreading the cost of a subscription — albeit the total cost of a year’s subscription was a little higher ($95.88) when paying monthly. At the time, Amazon confirmed to us the monthly billing option was just a test — so it’s not too surprising that, two weeks on, the monthly option has now been discontinued. The nixing of the $7.99 monthly Prime billing option was spotted earlier by Phandroid. Amazon provided TechCrunch with the following statement confirming it has suspended the service We regularly test new options for our customers. At this time, we are no longer signing up new customers for monthly memberships of Amazon Prime. Amazon would not comment on why the test has been terminated after such a short period, or confirm whether it plans to offer monthly billing for Prime in future.</Content></Article>
