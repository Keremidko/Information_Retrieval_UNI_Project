The Dronie is a UAV with a camera mount that records dronies to post to its official Twitter account using a camera mounted to its undercarriage, and Twitter’s six-second video service Vine as the publication method. The first dronie captured by the account features Sir Patrick Stewart, whose selfie game is famously tight. And with our first official #dronie from #CannesLions, a new bromance is born! cc @SirPatStew @joell https://t.co/ZL5PthcRkh — Dronie (@dronie) June 15, 2014 The account was created by Twitter Advertising, and Twitter VP of Brand Strategy Joel Lunenfeld co-stars in the Patrick Stewart inaugural edition. The project is part of a larger push by Twitter’s advertising department to showcase the importance of live coverage at the annual awards show, which is designed to honor creative communications professionals. It’s a smart way to highlight two Twitter products (the main network and Vine) with a modern trend and a robotics hobbyist angle thrown in for good measure. Only time will tell whether the Dronie becomes a regular fixture even at more star-studded events, but that will likely depend on how quickly the public grows tired of UAVs shooting video while flying away from their subjects in reverse.</Content></Article>
