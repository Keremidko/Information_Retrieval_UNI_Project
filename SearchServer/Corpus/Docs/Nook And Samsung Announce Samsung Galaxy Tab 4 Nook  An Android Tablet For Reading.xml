It includes something called the “Barnes &amp; Noble Advantage,” a deeply linked app that allows for book downloads as well as tech support “It’s the first ever full-featured Android tablet designed for reading,” said B&amp;N CEO Michael P. Huseby. The new device will appear in B&amp;N stores and the booksellers will offer in-store sales and support, including app setup and book browsing. It will also support “in store reading,” which allows you to read titles while in the store. To be clear, this is a Samsung device being sold in B&amp;N stores with a bit of branding. In terms of partnerships it’s not a bad idea but it does suggest that dedicated Nook hardware is no longer a priority. The Galaxy Tab 4 Nook is on sale today in stores and online for $179 after $20 rebate. This is the same price available online at Amazon and other retailers. We’ll have a hands-on shortly. scaled.02_VerticalHomeScreen scaled.01_HorizontalHomeScreen scaled.12_VerticalKidsContentScreen  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit</Content></Article>
