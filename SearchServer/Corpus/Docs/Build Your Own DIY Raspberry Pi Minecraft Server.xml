While you can easily run a server on any computer (the program requires a server app to run in conjunction with a client “game” app), why not use your newly acquired Raspberry Pi? I don’t know! This Instructable essentially tells you how to make a Minecraft Server in a few easy steps and, with a little effort, port forward that server so you and your friends can connect to it remotely. You should note that the instructions are little aged but if you’ve picked up a RaspPi for Christmas it might make a fun afternoon project for you and the wee ones. After all, why lay around all day watching The Wire when you and your kids can smash Creepers and herd pigs? via Adafruit</Content></Article>
