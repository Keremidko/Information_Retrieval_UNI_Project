It’s the product of a collaboration between Armani, Samsung and Microsoft. That’s right: a €700 phone that runs WinMo 6.5. Oh, dear. The phone, I think, doesn’t look bad at all. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, so to speak—QWERTY slider with touchscreen for good measure—nor does it really have it. It’s not like this phone is aimed at you or I or anything. The specs: 3.5-inch AMOLED screen, built-in GPD, 8GB storage, 5-megapixel camera. Again, nothing crazy, and you could rattle off a dozen other phones to bring more or less the same specs to the table without having to fork over that kind of money. Armani himself, at the phone’s unveiling in Milan, called the phone “perfect for today’s managers.” It’s something Ari in Entourage would use.</Content></Article>
