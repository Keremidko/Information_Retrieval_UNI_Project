Our old friend, the iPod classic, is no more. Apple unceremoniously removed the much-beloved media player from its iPod product page, leaving just the shuffle, nano, and touch to carry the iPod standard. This was years in the making. The click wheel-enabled iPod was just no longer relevant in the day of high-capacity flash storage and streaming music services. Sure, there are certain use cases where the high-capacity memory still makes sense, but for the most part, it was time for the iPod classic to be put down. But let’s remember the iPod classic during its heyday – when it was displayed with silhouettes using white earbuds dancing in front of vibrant backgrounds. This was the model that started it all.
