Previously, he had been tipped to bid $1.8 billion for the team. The Clippers are in flux at the moment after their owner, Donald Sterling, was recorded saying a number of racist comments. The NBA fined him. He’s made public comments indicating the he may fight a forced sale. According to the Times, rival offers came in at $1.2 and $1.6 billion. This is not Ballmer’s first time basketball rodeo. He previously tried to keep the Seattle Supersonics in the city before the NBA squad moved to Oklahoma City to become the Thunder. Ballmer later tried to buy the Sacramento Kings and move them to Seattle. Microsoft, of course, is headquartered in nearby Redmond. Ballmer has indicated that if successful in buying the Clippers, they would remain in L.A. Now that Ballmer has handed the reins of power to Satya Nadella, he has more time on his hands.
