It’ll cost you $24.99 or over 24 months, with $0 up front, or $599.76 all told – Just $120 more than the 32 GB Wi-Fi only version. The LTE version has the same specs otherwise, boasting Android 5.0 Lollipop, an 8.9-inch display with 2048×1536 resolution, Gorilla Glass 3 and a 64-bit Nvidia Tegra K1 dual-core processor with a 192-core Kepler graphics processor. We’ve already rendered a verdict on the tablet – it’s a solid choice for those looking for Android slates, and a great option if you’re looking to play a lot of games or do graphics-intensive work. But it doesn’t have the most amazing design or build quality in the world. Still, with LTE, it’s going to be one of the best cellular-capable Android devices you can get; with the caveat that at $600, you could (and should) easily get an iPad with LTE capabilities and similar storage. No word yet on when exactly it’ll hit Google Play, so it might be worth waiting to see how that works out, but T-Mobile’s model likely isn’t locked if you’ve got a strong hunger.</Content></Article>
