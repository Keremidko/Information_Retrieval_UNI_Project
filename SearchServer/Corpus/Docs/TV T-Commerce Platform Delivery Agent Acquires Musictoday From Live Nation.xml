Today, the company acquired Musictoday from Live Nation Entertainment at an undisclosed amount. Delivery Agent creates a catalog of products seen on television and movies., which can then be purchased through an e-commerce site or t-commerce application. This e-commerce site helps networks monetize their content while keeping overhead costs low. Musictoday is a white-label e-commerce provider for recording artists. Mike Fitzsimmons, chairman and CEO of Delivery Agent says his company will bring its monetization capabilities for Musictoday’s clients such as the ability to purchase directly from live tweets, music videos and live-streamed concerts. “Our primary focus has been around television and movies … over the years we’ve developed an omni-channel commerce platform that enables viewers and audiences to purchase products related to what they see through any digital device,” said Fitzsimmons. “We think our technology fits really nicely with the industry of recording artists.”   Featured Image: Delivery Agent</Content></Article>
