Startup Europe Summit will feature some key leaders of Europe’s technology industry and key decision makers from the European Commission. The aim is to get Europe on the right track in terms of how it deals with tech startups and wider issues. Joining the event will be the people who are making decisions about how Europe engages with startups as a whole. These include: Andrus Ansip, recently appointed the European Commission Vice President for the Digital Single Market, and Digital Commissioner Gunther Oettinger, who will join former European Commissioner Vice President Neelie Kroes and other members of the Commission and European Parliament. In fact this is the first time Ansip, who is new in the job, will be engaging with the wider European startup ecosystem properly. Hosted at Factory​ Berlin, no schedule will be announced publicly until just before the event to facilitate the best conversation, according to Factory CEO and organiser, Simon Schaefer. A number of corporates are joining (Google, Microsoft, Telefonica among others), as well as a number of key startups and VCs such as Transferwise, King.com, Prezi, Blockchain, Jolla, Wooga, Career Foundry and EyeEm along with Atomico, Balderton, Accel, Index, Mangrove, Lakestar, Mojo Capital and others. TechCrunch will be hosting a dinner also, and I’ll be attending for TechCrunch. Tickets will be open to the public beginning Monday, February 2nd.</Content></Article>
