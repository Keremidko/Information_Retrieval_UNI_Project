The birds are chirping, the flowers are blooming and, soon, coders will be hacking together APIs at the Disrupt NY Hackathon. We’ve just released another batch of tickets. Registration is free. Grab a ticket here or on the form below. The 24-hour event kicks off on Saturday May 3 and runs through the night until the teams take the Disrupt stage on Sunday to present their creations. TechCrunch and the Hackathon sponsors will of course provide food, plenty of caffeinated beverages and Nerf guns to keep everyone from falling asleep. Spots are limited so register while you still can. We’ll release more tickets as the show nears. Good luck and happy coding!
