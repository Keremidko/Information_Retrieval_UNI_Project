If you’ve been thinking about hoppin’ on board the T-Mo train but were worried their data speeds would suck in your area, good news: the company is pledging to have their entire network (or, at least, everywhere they offer even crappy 2G speeds, currently) up on 4G LTE by mid-2015. As it currently stands, T-Mobile’s LTE is live on less than half of their network. They should pass the halfway mark sometime this year, though — and the upgrades should be completely done within 12-15 months. What does this mean for you? Basically: if you’re on T-Mobile but live somewhere where your phone’s data connection hasn’t sped up much in the last decade, things are about to get a whole lot faster. And if you live somewhere that already has 4G, you’ll find yourself dropping down to slower speeds much less often whilst out and about. Let’s just hope the potential Sprint/T-Mobile merger doesn’t screw up their plans.</Content></Article>
