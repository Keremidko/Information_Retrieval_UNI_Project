Drastically rupture the status quo? Do you want to see tech done better? Can you make a really, really good Vine? We want to see what “disrupt” really means to our readers. That’s why we’ve created a three-part social media contest for you to show us just how creative you can get. Today, Day 1 of TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco, we want you to do it for the Vine. Send us your Disrupt Vines using the hashtag #TCDisrupt, and we’ll select the best one. The winner will receive a Rolling Spider Parrot MiniDrone – a quadcopter with pre-set controls for doing instant loop-de-loops and flips, ability to fly and scale walls. Great for non-destructive indoor shenanigans. We’ll also give your Vine some extra publicity by featuring it on our social channels.   Yes, we’re serious. After Monday, not only will one of you be a master of Vine, but the owner of a drone. The guidelines are simple: 1. Create a Vine video showing us – in any capacity – what “disrupt” means to you. Make us laugh. Make us cry. Inspire us. Whatever works for you. 2. Post your Vine video with the hashtag #TCDisrupt by 9:00 AM PST on 9/9 so we can locate your brilliant creations. 3.  A winner will be selected by tomorrow morning. We’ll comment on the winner’s Vine so you know that you won. If you don’t respond within 24 hours, we’ll select a new winner. 4. After you respond to us, the Rolling Spider MiniDrone from Parrot will be your new baby! Good luck, and stay tuned for tomorrow’s challenge.</Content></Article>
