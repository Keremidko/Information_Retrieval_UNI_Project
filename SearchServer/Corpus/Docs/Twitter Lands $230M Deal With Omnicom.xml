The deal expanded Twitter’s reach away from its own user base. That matters as investors appear to be skittish regarding Twitter’s ability to grow its own audience. At the time of purchase, Twitter indicated that it planned to use MoPub’s technology to build real-time bidding into the Twitter ads platform so our advertisers can more easily automate and scale their buys.” The deal is the second piece of good news announced today. A report from eMarketer indicated that the company’s growth in Asia could impress. Twitter’s shares are trading higher today, besting the larger market rally, but only slightly. Investors don’t appear to overly impressed by the twin positive entries, implying that this sort of growth and deal flow may be already priced into the share price of the social company.
