At a party thrown by Ashton Kutcher’s A-Grade Investments at SXSW over the weekend, the rapper Nas took the stage while famed entrepreneur-turned-investor Ben Horowitz danced alongside him. Horowitz is a big fan of hip-hop, often sprinkling it into his blog posts and his recent book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things. He’s also broken color lines as the so-called “Jackie Robinson of barbecue,” according to African American friends. And, well, he and Nas are some sort of friends. That said, there are no words to describe how awkward he appears in this video, which a tipster shot at the event and sent to TechCrunch. Horowitz almost looks like he’s rapping along a bit, perhaps stepping into the standard role of hype man. (In case you can’t tell, that’s Horowitz on the left, while Kutcher is on the right.)

He also spent time signing and handing out copies at a private a16z event earlier that night. The book is apparently pretty good.
