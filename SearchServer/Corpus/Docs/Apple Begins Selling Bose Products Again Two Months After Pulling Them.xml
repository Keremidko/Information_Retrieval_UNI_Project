The return comes nearly two months after it pulled the range for unknown reasons. It was never clear why Apple cut Bose out, but it is likely to be related to a lawsuit that Bose filed against Beats, the audio company that Apple purchased for $3 billion earlier this year, in July over noise-cancelling headphones. The two sides settled on October 10, ending the need for the case to go to court, but Bose products vanished from Apple’s online store and offline retail outlets just a week later. Bose also stole a march on its rival when it became the official audio product for the NFL right before Apple’s purge, although that didn’t stop many sports stars from using Beats products — and being fined for doing so in some cases. Perhaps it was a case of Cupertino flexing its retail muscles as a warning or a move to help drive sales of Beats, but either way the relationship seems more stable now. That means that you can hit up Apple’s on- and offline stores in the U.S. before Christmas if you know someone who’d appreciate a new set of headphones or speakers in their stocking this year.</Content></Article>
