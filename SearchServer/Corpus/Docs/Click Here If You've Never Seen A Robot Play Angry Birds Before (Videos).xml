When they’re not busy planning world domination, they apparently play Angry Birds just like the rest of us. OptoFidelity, a Finnish company that specializes in machine vision and optical measurement technology, in addition to other things I don’t understand, recently produced a physical robot that knows how to kill nasty green pigs. It most certainly beats the crap out of this (OptoFidelity 1 – Stanford University 0). OptoFidelity’s Hans Kuosmanen and Jere Tuulkari go into more detail in another video: And for the techies, an excerpt from the forum post linked above (and a third video): OptoFidelity, a National Instruments Alliance Partner, recently expanded from vision applications to building test systems. To create the robot that plays Angry Birds, Optofidelity engineers needed a real-time system and field-programmable gate array (FPGA). They used NI products, specifically NI CompactRIO, NI Single-Board RIO platforms, and NI LabVIEW software, because they were the best fit to meet the specifications required for this sweet app. The application allows their customers to create their own driver without modifying the main software, ensuring compatibility with different display drivers. What’s more, this application isn’t restricted to just the Nokia handset in the video. It is an independent platform that will work with the display of most devices.
