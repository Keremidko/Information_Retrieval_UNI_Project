As we discussed on the show, Kleiner Perkins has been making a solid bet on mobile for the past few years. In fact, we’ve confirmed with the firm that it has put more than $450 million in 40 mobile companies. As Murphy explains, these investments include both the $200 million iFund (launched in 2008) and separate investments. So now the $450 million in mobile investments are part of the firm’s digital investing in both consumer and enterprise companies. For background, the iFund was initially a $100 million collaborative initiative with Apple that focuses on funding and building applications on the iOS platform and the mobile Internet. The company doubled this to $200 million within a few years. But Kleiner has expanded the mobile focus to include enterprise, as well. And Kleiner has built a pretty impressive collection of consumer-focused mobile investments including Shopkick, Path, Spotify, Pinger and Square. Of late, the focus has expanded to enterprise with companies like Apperian, Crittercism and Egnyte. Check out the video above from Murphy for more.</Content></Article>
