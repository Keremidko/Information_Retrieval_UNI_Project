Today the United States government released an email from Snowden asking several questions. The email, notably, is mostly benign, and is not the sort of email that would qualify as strong internal “whistleblowing.” That the government is therefore willing to release it isn’t surprising. Snowden himself has indicated that he raised internal worry more than 10 times before he leaked his set of documents. Today at the briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney indicated the email would be released. It was published on both the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s website and by Senator Feinstein.
