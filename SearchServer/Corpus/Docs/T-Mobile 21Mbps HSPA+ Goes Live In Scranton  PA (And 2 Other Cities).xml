Just days after he finally gathered up the gusto to leave Dunder-Mifflin, ol’ Scranton, PA is at long last getting support for T-Mobile’s HSPA+ network.

Also getting support for the network (but not so easily squeezed into pop culture references): Wilkes Barre, PA, Ft. Meyers, FL, and Pueblo, CO. All in all, T-Mobile’s “4G-ish” network is now flowing in right around 170 regions.</Content></Article>
