He added that there might be some salvageable material. There isn’t a plan B. The issue is that broadcasters believe Aereo is stealing their signals out of the air and rebroadcasting those signals to consumers unlawfully. However, Aereo works very similarly to the way a regular set of rabbit ears does. Because each Aereo user has their own remote antenna that records their very own copy of various programs, the startup has been consistently successful in court. The fate of the upstart apparently rests in the hands of the Supreme Court. The main question put before the SCOTUS is whether or not Aereo’s service constitutes a public or private performance. Despite legal issues from the start, Aereo has methodically rolled its service out to new markets and raised $34 million in funding earlier this year. A victory would vindicate Aereo’s argument, opening up the antiquated TV market to much-needed disruption.
