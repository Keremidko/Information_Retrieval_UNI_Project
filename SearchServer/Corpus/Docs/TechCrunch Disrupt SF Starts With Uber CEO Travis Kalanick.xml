And if anything will shock me back to life, it’ll be Travis Kalanick, the controversial CEO of the controversial startup (if a company can still be called a startup after raising $1.5 billion in venture capital), Uber. Travis is on stage first thing Monday morning to kick things off, and I’ll be interviewing him. And don’t worry that this’ll just be another boring interview. First, I avoid boring interviews like the plague. And second, I’ve known Travis for a long, long time. There’s much to discuss. This is the second time Kalanick has spoken at Disrupt. He joins Disrupt SF’s impressive roster of speakers, which includes Marc Benioff, Vinod Khosla, Mark Cuban, Elizabeth Holmes and Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen. There are still tickets available for Disrupt SF, which kicks off with a 24-hour hackathon on September 6.
