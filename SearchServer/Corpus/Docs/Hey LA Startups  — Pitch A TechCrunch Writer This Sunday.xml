A TechCrunch writer (me) is visiting your fair city and is ready to uncover some startups. Come pitch me tomorrow, Sunday (8th Feb) at Alfred Coffee (in the alley) on 8509 Melrose Avenue, West Hollywood, 90069 between 3pm and 5pm. I’ll take real short pitches and can follow-up later. Who knows, you may end up on TechCrunch. Fill out this form so we can email you if any details of the meeting change. This is not a formal TechCrunch Meetup. It’s more like ‘Office Hours’ where I’ll take a short pitch. Hope to see you there.</Content></Article>
