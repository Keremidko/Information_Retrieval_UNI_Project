And, in an experiment to fix them, TechCrunch has partnered up with tech startup Reframe It, which is developing a deliberative polling product for technology policy issues with the help of a grant from the Knight Foundation. Deliberative polling is a new, scientific and deliberative process which gathers a randomly selected group of citizens in an attempt to understand what a larger group of people would think about an issue if they were informed. We are selecting a group of our readers to participate in TechCrunch’s first experiment with deliberative polling. From those that submit here, we’ll choose a representative sample of readers who will discuss important political topics, ask questions of leading experts and TechCrunch writers, and might even be included in featured posts. As an added bonus, all participants will be enrolled to win a ticket to TechCrunch Disrupt, as well as other prizes from vendors like Amazon, Jawbone and more. So, if you’re interested in applying to figure out what deliberative polling is, please answer a few questions to see if you’re a fit.
