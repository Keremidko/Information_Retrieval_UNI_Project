It’s work gloves, with LEDs that attach in a number of places so you can see what you’re doing. In the immortal words of Jay-Z, “What more can I say?” I guess I could say that it looks like there are two attachment points on the index finger, one on the back of the hand, and one somewhere I can’t see. They only cost $23, which is a great price, if you ask me. If you work under your car a lot or are planning some home improvements necessitating lots of running wires through crannies and so on, these could be quite helpful.
