With traffic that surpasses the likes of Facebook and Tumblr at peak hours, Twitch is often called the ESPN of online gaming. It’s one of the hottest companies around these days, as evidenced by the current rumors that Google is reportedly keen to snap it up in a billion-dollar deal. So it was no surprise to see that Twitch’s San Francisco headquarters is basically a big shrine to all things gaming, with big and small references to everything from games like Super Mario, to Portal, to Halo, and everything in between. There’s even a gravity gun on premises, which unfortunately we weren’t able to take for a spin. Maybe someday. As you can see in the video embedded above, Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear told me all the references are a key part of Twitch’s interior design. “We wanted to make it feel like you were walking into a piece of the Internet, where there are references everywhere, and every little thing is something fun,” he said. Walking through, I wished that I were more well-versed in gaming culture, since there were definitely lots of things that went right over my head. Even so, it was lots of fun — I pretty much had a smile on my face the whole time. Check it all out in the video embedded above.</Content></Article>
