The 2012 International CES is scheduled January 10-13, 2012, in Las Vegas, Nevada. CEA says the full line-up of 2012 International CES keynote addresses will be announced in coming months. Ballmer’s preshow keynote address is slated for 6:30 PM on Monday, January 9, in The Venetian. Microsoft has used the CES keynote stage in previous years to unveil products like the original Xbox and Avatar Kinect.
