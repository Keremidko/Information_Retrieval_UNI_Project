I got the chance to sit down with CEO James Park to talk wearables, heart rate monitors, and his expectations for the Apple Watch. See, Fitbit isn’t afraid and I’m not sure they should be. While a true popular wearable will cut into some fashion and tech watch markets, Park feels that his audience is considerably different than Apples. In short, the folks who want Fitbits aren’t the folks who want Apple Watches. Park is a well-spoken and surprisingly interesting CEO and it’s great getting to catch up with him at CES. Check out the video and expect reviews of the new devices soon.</Content></Article>
