In a public exchange of letters, the former Microsoft CEO announced that he is stepping down from the software company’s board, effective immediately.

Facebook LinkedIn Steve Ballmer Leaves Microsoft Ballmer’s letter is worth reading. A passage: I bleed Microsoft —have for 34 years and I always will. I continue to love discussing the company’s future. I love trying new products and sending feedback. I love reading about what is going on at the company. Count on me to keep ideas and inputs flowing. The company will move to higher heights. I will be proud, and I will benefit through my share ownership. I promise to support and encourage boldness by management in my role as a shareholder in any way I can. Ballmer’s tenure as CEO was controversial, but it was rare to find someone who doubted his conviction, whatever the efficacy of his decisions. Microsoft’s stock is all but unchanged on the news. The former chief executive officer cited his new, post-Microsoft commitments, including his recent purchase of the Los Angeles Clippers, as reasons for the departure.
