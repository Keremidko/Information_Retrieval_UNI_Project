It only takes one midnight trip to the pharmacy for you to agree with me. That’s where Le Parcel comes in. It’s a new startup that lets you choose which brand of feminine hygiene products you’d like to have shipped to you monthly, along with some chocolate of course. After hitting up the website, users can choose up to 30 different products, including tampons, pads, and panty liners. Le Parcel offers brands like Playtex, Tampax, Kotex, and Always. You can choose up to thirty different products, which means that you can choose 10 Regular Tampax tampons, 10 Super Tampax Tampons, and 10 Always panty liners, or whatever it is that your cycle requires.

Users can even indicate when in the month they need their shipments to arrive, ensuring that Le Parcel arrives before Aunt Flo. Surfing the crimson wave is pain enough, but Le Parcel looks to make it a bit less excruciating.</Content></Article>
