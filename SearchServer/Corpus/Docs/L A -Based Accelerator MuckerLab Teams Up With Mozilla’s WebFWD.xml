The new six-month program will include three months at MuckerLab and access to Mozilla’s global network, infrastructure and other resources. The program is especially looking for L.A.-based entrepreneurs and hopes to give a boost to L.A.’s tech ecosystem. The joint MuckerLab-WebFWD program is especially looking for projects and companies which extend the Web and its “openness.” Given Mozilla’s involvement, there will also be a focus on web-based apps and services. The idea here, says MuckerLab, is to “offer open source entrepreneurs a chance to create new a venture in-residence at the MuckerLab offices in Los Angeles.” According to Pascal Finette, the director of Mozilla’s WebFWD acceleration program, “the new MuckerLab-Mozilla partnership will allow open source entrepreneurs, especially those based in Los Angeles, to receive a great jump start to their venture via resources and expertise.” It’s worth noting that in addition to the joint program with Mozilla, MuckerLab is also now taking applications for its regular fall semester. The standard MuckerLab program is somewhat similar to Y Combinator, as it provides teams with $21,000 in funding, office space and access to mentors and marketing and legal support. The program runs for 12 weeks and ends with a demo day where the new startups get to pitch potential investors. Recent MuckerLab graduates include Instacanvas, Wallaby Financial, Laffster and SurfAir.</Content></Article>
