This also marks the beginning of a new price cycle for the carriers, which seems to be starting at Amazon Wireless, where the $199 Galaxy S III has been dropped to $99 on Verizon and Sprint. Sprint, as you may recall, will be getting the Samsung Galaxy Note II on October 25 for $299. The Droid Razr HD and Razr Maxx HD mark the continuation of a profitable alliance in Verizon and Motorola, and solidify it with Google as a new backbone for Motorola after the $12.5 billion acquisition. But it’s also worth remembering that these phones ship with Android 4.0.4 ICS. Not Jelly Bean. Whatever the case, these are top-of-the-line phones, with 4.7-inch Super AMOLED HD 720p displays, 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon processors, and an 8-megapixel shooter that captures 1080p video. Not to mention a super thin Kevlar fiber casing. And to top that off, Motorola promises great battery life, which is a struggle for all of us. The Droid Razr HD and Maxx HD have 2530 mAH and 3300 mAH batteries respectively, promising something like 16 and 21 hours of straight usage. Both super phones are available now at Verizon.</Content></Article>
