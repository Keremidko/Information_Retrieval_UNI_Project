The entire manual for just such a phone has leaked. So far, at least, it looks like the rumor mill nailed this one: Just as whispers predicted, the handset is called the “Droid Turbo,” and it’s essentially a fancied-up version of the already damn fine 2014 Moto X. 5.2″ “Ultra high-definition” display? Check. Bigger battery? Check. 21-megapixel rear camera (versus the Moto X’s 13 megapixel shooter)? Yep. You can find the purportedly official manual here. Before you get too excited, remember it’s October. It’s been nearly a year since Google announced the Nexus 5, and the Nexus 6 (or whatever Google ends up calling the next Nexus) is seemingly right around the corner. If Google is planning on continuing its tradition of launching an unlocked, high-end handset that gets all of the new Android updates first, now seems like an unwise time to buy a carrier-locked, on-contract device. While there’s no guarantee that the next Nexus will work on Verizon (the Nexus 5 doesn’t, after all), it’d be worthwhile for most Android fans to wait and see how the next month or so plays out. It may seem like there’s always going to be a better phone next month, but it’s particularly worth considering right now. [Via Droid Life]</Content></Article>
