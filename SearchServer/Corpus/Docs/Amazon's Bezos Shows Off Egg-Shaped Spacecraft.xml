They’ve been working on the ugliest personal spacecraft ever for a while. Virgin definitely has the edge on design here, but check out what Bezos’ little egg can do in the above video. I don’t see many-a-flame, do you? It only got 85-meters high though, so don’t get too excited to hop in and head to the Moon just yet. The flight was done on November 13th, 2006 and the ship is called Goddard. If you still think it’s cooler than the Virgin space stuff, check out the BBC article.
