The Startup Weekend organization, which is supported by the Kauffman Foundation and the social learning startup Grockit, offers intense 54-hour events where entrepreneurs come together to share ideas, form teams, build products and launch startups. The EDU vertical within Startup Weekend was officially launched in September, and kicked off its launch with events in Seattle, San Francisco and Washington D.C. over the past month. This month, Startup Weekend will host its next EDU event in London from November 25th-27th. The organization will soon announce more events that will be taking place worldwide over the next 12 months. “Given its dedication to education reform and extensive networks in the space, the Gates Foundation is the ideal partner for us to scale the Startup Weekend EDU initiative,” said Farb Nivi, founder of Grockit about the grant from the Gates Foundation.
