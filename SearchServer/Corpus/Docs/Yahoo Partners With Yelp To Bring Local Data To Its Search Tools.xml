The deal will see traditional Yelp information, such as ratings and user photos piped into Yahoo. Put another way, Yahoo’s search is now flavored with more third-party data that it lacks. Yahoo is no longer a company known for its search products, having long-ago ceded its search technology to Microsoft, but the company does command a slice of the query market. That slice is in decline, something that the company wants to correct. Yahoo has tried to slow, stall, or get out from under its search deal with Microsoft, given that the partnership has failed to perform up to financial expectations. But, lashed as Yahoo is to the Microsoft Bingwagon, the former is imitating the latter. Microsoft’s search engine also partnered with Yelp, albeit 2 years ago. As TechCrunch reported: Microsoft’s Bing is on a roll…in terms of new partnership announcements, that is. Today, Bing and Yelp are announcing a co-branded relationship that will bring Yelp’s local business content to Bing’s Local search pages. The pages will display “Powered by Yelp,” beginning today with full U.S. availability expected over the next few weeks. Yelp will bring its reviews, photos, business attributes and more to the Bing search engine, reinvigorating Microsoft’s efforts at taking on Google Place pages, which recently became Google+ Local. Yelp remains a trove of information that search companies et al like to have in their pocket. That or you have to collect it yourself, something that Google is betting it can pull off. Bing and Yahoo, lacking Google’s scale, seem content to buy off the shelf.</Content></Article>
