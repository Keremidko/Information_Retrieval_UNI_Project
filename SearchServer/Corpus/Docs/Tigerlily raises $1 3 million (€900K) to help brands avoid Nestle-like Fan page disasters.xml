It’d been a while since we’d heard anything from the company that we suggested Nestlé take a look at when the brand came under fire on social media platforms last year. Tigerlily had also caught a bit of attention before, as it was a finalist for LeWeb in 2009 and the Europas last year. But the startup that specializes in social marketing or Facebook fan page solutions has just announced that it has raised €900K or $1.3 million. The funding comes from 3 France-based funds: Seventure Partners, Boulas Ventures and newly founded entrepreneur-investor club Seed4Soft. Tigerlily says it’s planning to use the funding primarily for European expansion – mainly in the UK. And while the company doesn’t have plans to open a foreign office right away it is open to collaborating with people based in London. Tigerlily’s CEO, Matthieu Chereau, says the 10-person team should be more than doubled by the end of the year. There are currently over 10,000 different brands currently using Tigerlily’s solutions, which provide a number of tools for managing and developing Facebook fan pages. Some of these tools allow Fan page administrators to moderate comments, offer localized content or coupons to their fans, and integrate shopping applications. Tigerlily does use a Freemium business model, meaning that a free version is available for most of its solutions. The competitor of Sociabliz is also the first investment that Seed4Soft has announced since its official launch at the end of March. The investor-club that specializes in enterprise software had made several other investments prior to its launch date.     CrunchBase Information Tigerlily Information provided by CrunchBase</Content></Article>
