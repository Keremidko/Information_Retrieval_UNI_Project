Other participants in this round include existing investors Matrix Partners, Verizon Ventures and Blue Cloud Ventures. Today’s round follows three previous rounds valued at $4 million, $12.5 million and $11.2 million, respectively. CloudBees started out as a Java-centric Platform-as-a-Service company, but it’s now solely focused on providing Jenkins support and services to enterprises. It offers large businesses a number of Jenkins plug-ins that improve the service’s security and availability capabilities, for example. In addition, it also offers a cloud-based Jenkins service. Current customers include the likes of Northrop Grumman, Hyatt Hotels, EMC, Cisco and the Federal Reserve. Unsurprisingly, the company plans to use this fresh funding round to finance its investments in its Jenkins platform in order to launch a number of new products over the course of the next year. “We will use the additional capital to serve the growing demand for Jenkins-based solutions worldwide, to continue to capture market share and to further cement our position as the continuous delivery leader,” said CloudBees CEO and founder Sacha Labourey in today’s announcement.
