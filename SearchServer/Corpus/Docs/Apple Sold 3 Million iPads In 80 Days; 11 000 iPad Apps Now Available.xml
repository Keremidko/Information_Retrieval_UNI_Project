The statement also reported that there are 11,000 iPad apps available for the device. On May 31, Apple reported that it had sold 2 million iPad, showing that the company has sold one million more tablet devices in less than a month. The company only started shipping units to customers in countries outside the United States in late May, which could account for the faster growth in sales. At the 2 million mark, Apple said the iPad had over 5,000 new apps for the iPad. Clearly this number has more than doubled, to 11,000 total iPad apps. There’s no doubt that iPads are flying off the shelves, as Apple sold a million devices in less than a month. As previously announced, the iPad will be available in nine more – but still unnamed – countries in July and additional countries later this year.</Content></Article>
