While it’s not difficult to make a RaspPi board do cool stuff, getting it to communicate with the wider world is a bit of a challenge. That’s why Ryo Koyama, Mike Johnson, and Doug Olekin made Weaved. While the goal is a bit broad – “Weaved is looking to enable Internet of Things for everyone, and sees a vision where IoT capabilities are a feature onto all electronic devices,” said Koyama – the idea is fairly simple. By giving a RaspPi Internet of Things capabilities, you can expand the scope of the hardware immensely. Essentially, using the service and a Wi-Fi connection, the RaspPi board becomes a secure node in your private IoT network. This means you can login to your Pis and get notifications from various inputs on the board. This has always been the stickiest part of building a Raspberry Pi (or electronics project) and Weaved aims to be the AWS of the space. “We believe that a software/service solution must exist that allows for ‘drop in’ of IoT capability, without requiring knowledge/engineering expertise for Servers, networking, mobile, security and firmware development,” said Koyama. The free version allows you to support one Pi while a paid version allows you to handle a fleet of boards. You can try the service right here. While the need for sending notifications to your iPhone via a Raspberry Pi board may seem far-out and wild, remember that it wasn’t too long ago that the idea you could fit an entire computer into an Altoids tin was also pretty wacky.</Content></Article>
