Amazon had said it would support it sometime, though they didn’t specify an exact timeline, so seeing it roll out this quickly is likely a pleasant surprise for card owners. We’ve received direct reports of customers being able to add their cards this morning, and are also seeing users report their success on Twitter. The photo above shows an actual card in one user’s Passbook, after Amazon enabled the feature sometime early today. That didn't take as long as I expected.

Amazon confirms that the card now supports Apple Pay, and directs cardholders to this site from Chase if they’re looking for more info.</Content></Article>
