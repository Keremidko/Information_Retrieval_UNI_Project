This seems to have paid off somewhatâ€”the company has seen over 1 million downloads of its iPhone app. Mobile, specifically, has been a growth area for the Q&amp;A platform, with a 100 percent increase in visits to Ask.com from smart phones over the last year (mobile is 10 percent of total usage). Today, Ask.com is bringing its Q&amp;A platform to Android devices. Ask says that the Android app is now available in the Android Marketplace and Amazon AppStore for Android. Includes all of the functionality of its iPhone application including voice to text features, the ability to get web results as well as top-voted published answers from other Ask.com users. You can also specifically send a question to a real user, and activate push notifications to alert you to when a new answer has arrived. One of the Android-specific features is the ability to filter Q&amp;A by topics that match your profile. You can also follow users who provide interesting answers, and personalize your Q&amp;A experience with content from these connections. Ask says that iPhones currently make up about 55 percent of Ask.com smartphone mobile traffic while Android makes up about 40 percent. Android traffic to Ask.com has skyrocketed 60 percent so far this year, so an Android app makes sense.</Content></Article>
