Allcast for iOS, which had been in beta since October and available to devices running iOS 8 only, lets Apple fans easily stream their on-device photos, videos, music, not to mention content from Dropbox, Google Drive, Google+ and Picasa to a TV. The app links up to a range of different devices — including Google’s Chromecast, Apple TV, Amazon’s Fire TV, Roku, Xbox, AirPlay devices, and selected smart TVs — to beam the contents on your small screen to your big screen. The app is free to use and, like the Android version, it offer in-app purchases that remove the ads and pre-set streaming limits. There is also an app for Amazon phones and tablets. We took the app for a spin back when it first launch in December 2013 and were hugely impressed, and it has since added support for even more kinds of content. Despite a run in with Google, which last year removed (then restored) support for the Chromecast, Allcast has blossomed into a useful app for anyone who is into streaming content. Now, at last, Apple customers are invited to the party.</Content></Article>
