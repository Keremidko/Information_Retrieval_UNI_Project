According to a Tweet from the private car service, the company is planning to expand to Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and D.C. Uber just advertised a number of job postings for general managers in these cities. As we reported a few months ago, Uber recently started testing the service, which allows you order a private car from an iPhone app at discounted rates; in New York, after being available in San Francisco and Palo Alto. Uber, which just raised $11 million in funding, allows you to order a black car to come to your location on the mobile app, and then watch it come to you as the app tracks the car via GPS. Payments are handled automatically by charging the card you have on file, and it costs at least 50% more than a taxi. The service has a loyal following in San Francisco, and it’s not surprising that Uber is looking to expand the service to other cities. According to the job posting for positions, the GM will be responsible for the development and growth of the business in the new city and will have oversight of everything going on in the city, essentially starting and growing the business in the area. CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick tells us “the Tweet speaks for itself” and declines to comment further. The official launch of Uber in New York is coming soon (hopefully in time for TechCrunch Disrupt).</Content></Article>
