The news broke in the Wall Street Journal and it’s discussed further in posts from the Google Analytics and Adometry teams. Google wrote that Adometry “will build on the momentum of our existing measurement and analytics offerings, which include Google Analytics Premium as well as other products,” adding: Attribution solutions, like Adometry’s, help businesses better understand the influence that different marketing tools — digital, offline, email, and more — have along their customers’ paths to purchase (http://goo.gl/tXTliw). This heightened understanding, in turn, enables businesses to measure marketing impact, allocate their resources more wisely, and provide people with ads and messages that they’re likely to care about. The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Adometry raised around $44 million in funding from investors, including Austin Ventures, Sierra Ventures and Shasta Ventures. Adometry will continue to serve existing customers, the companies said.</Content></Article>
