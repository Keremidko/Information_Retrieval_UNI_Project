Samsung will be streaming the event live on its YouTube account and we’ll have the stream right here for you to watch, too, so bookmark this page and check back at 11 AM PT/2 PM ET to catch all the action. In the meantime, check out the trailer Samsung has put out for the “Next Galaxy,” which we’ve already pointed out suggests we’ll see a fairly rugged piece of hardware revealed at the show. And if you really can’t wait for the official unveiling, we’ve got some spoilers that arrived early this morning showing off some Galaxy S5 hardware that made its way into the hands of bloggers a little bit ahead of schedule.</Content></Article>
