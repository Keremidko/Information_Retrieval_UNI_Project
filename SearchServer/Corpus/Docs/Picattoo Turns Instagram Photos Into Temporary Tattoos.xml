Or forehead. But probably your wrist. Or hand. Or… you get the picture. The Netherlands based service, which ships these fleeting ‘Insta-tats’ worldwide, has been launched by photography products company Ink361, which focuses on monetizing Instagram usage by offering a web viewer and print your photos service, among other photo-focused products. Its new Picattoo service will sell you 12 temporary tattoos, created from a dozen Instagram photos of your choosing (which must, however, be from your own Instagram account), for $14.99/£9.99. Postage worldwide is apparently free. The temporary tattoos — let’s call them ‘skin stickers’ — are laser printed in color onto temporary tattoo paper, and will apparently last for up to a week, depending on how carefully you treat them/how regularly you exfoliate the adorned area. In parallel with the Picattoo launch, Ink361 has also launched an online service for repurposing Instagram photos as printed, pocket-sized photobooks, called FastBook — one of many such printing services orbiting the digital photo-sharing juggernaut. FastBooks can be 24-pages or 48-pages, and start at $14.95. With Instagram’s monthly active user-base continuing to grow — it hit the 300 million mark, as of last December, up from 200 million in March last year — expect plenty more of these third party services to try to come up with ways to stand out and sell stuff to the Insta-ecosystem.</Content></Article>
