With this change, iOS 8 users will now have the option to unlock and access their Dropbox accounts using their own fingerprints. Dropbox is now one of several apps to have implemented support for Touch ID, following others like Amazon, Mint, Simple, Evernote, 1Password, Camera Plus and more. The update also optimizes Dropbox for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and adds a few other fixes, like stability and performance improvements, as well as a fix for previewing RTF files on iOS 8. Touch ID support, however, is the key new feature here, and for those users who are concerned that their accounts may have been affected by the recent hacking attempt, now would be a good time to change your Dropbox password while you’re setting up the Touch ID option. Dropbox already received a prior iOS 8 upgrade which introduced support for Notification Center widgets as well as a new Share extension. The former lets you view Dropbox files and updates on your iPhone’s lockscreen, while the latter allows files from other apps to be opened and saved into Dropbox.</Content></Article>
