According to Founder Alan Schaaf, the site sees 30 million uniques per month and a billion pageviews. (Yes, a billion!) Schaaf admits that the startup is sort of  “under the radar in the tech community.” But there’s clearly a large demand for an image-hosting site that doesn’t focus on personal or professional photos, but on other types of images. “I like to think of an image as different from a photo,” says Schaaf, “you would put your photos on places like Facebook or Flickr, but if you just have an image – which can be like a screenshot, a meme, something you hacked together in PhotoShop – you need a place for those too. We want to be that place.” The full backstage interview is below: Facebook LinkedIn Imgur Photo Hosting Site Wins Crunchy</Content></Article>
