You step up onto the foot pads, tip your feet forward, and two motorized wheels carry you around while gyroscopes auto-balance the Hovertrax so you don’t fall off. What’s hilarious is just how casual you look riding it. You’re basically standing upright while cruising up to 8 miles at 5 miles per hour on a single charge. On sale for $995, though, I don’t know who’s going to buy it. And neither does SoloWheel, the company who makes it. I asked and their representative told me they’ve seen it bought for kids as a toy, for adults to travel long indoor distances like at airports, and for work to jet around warehouses. The tilt-based controls were surprisingly reactive and I didn’t want for more power. Still, I don’t think any amount of riding would make you feel like you weren’t about to faceplant. Standing up straight and forward seems like too precarious of a position to ride safely around traffic or any kind of ground turbulence. The Hovertrax squarely lands in the “fun to ride for five minutes at a gadget conference, insane to buy” category.</Content></Article>
