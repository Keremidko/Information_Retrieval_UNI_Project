Mayer argued that this dichotomy doesn’t matter, and that Yahoo needs to focus on building products that people love and delivering value. When Arrington mentioned Yahoo’s new “Netflix-style” video content, Mayer lit up, quickly discussing two new video series. Mayer said the video budget will be relatively stable year to year, and that the company is just “using it in a different way.” “Last year we produced 86 different series,” Mayer said. “None of whom you’ve ever heard about because it was sort of a failed branding exercise.” The company will now have fewer series, which will be branded and focused around its new Digital Magazines, and two new shows, called “Other Space” and “Sin City Saints.” marissa-mayer17 marissa-mayer16 marissa-mayer15 marissa-mayer14 marissa-mayer13 marissa-mayer12 marissa-mayer11 marissa-mayer marissa-mayer10 marissa-mayer9 marissa-mayer8 marissa-mayer7 marissa-mayer6 marissa-mayer5 marissa-mayer4 marissa-mayer3 marissa-mayer2 marissa-mayer1 marissa-mayer  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit “Now we’re doing fewer things that are bigger and have a slightly larger chance of success,” Mayer said. Starting on July 1, Yahoo will also be working with Live Nation to stream a live concert every day for a year. Facebook LinkedIn Marissa Mayer On the Last Two Years</Content></Article>
