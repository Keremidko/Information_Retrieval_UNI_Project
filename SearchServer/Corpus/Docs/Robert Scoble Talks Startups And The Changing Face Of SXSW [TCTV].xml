In case you missed the live show as it was happening, or were deterred by some audio issues that were happening at the time, we re-processed a few of the segments and the first one we’re posting is Scoble’s interview (FYI: my audio is still a bit louder than Scoble’s, so beware before you crank up the volume.) Watch the video above to hear Scoble’s thoughts on how SxSWi has grown over the past decade from a few “geeks off in the corner” to a massive gathering, what technology he’s most excited about right now (Highlight gets a mention), his time on the StartupBus, why he’s still bullish on Google+, the kind of startup pitch he’s sick of hearing, and lots more.</Content></Article>
