Now Musk has also confirmed on Twitter that SpaceX is working on a fleet of “advanced micro-satellites operating in large formations,” which will be officially announced in two to three months. The micro-satellites will be used to enable unfettered and “very low cost” Internet access. SpaceX is still in the early stages of developing advanced micro-satellites operating in large formations. Announcement in 2 to 3 months. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 11, 2014 @Shmizer1 unfettered certainly and at very low cost — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 11, 2014 Musk’s tweets were in response to a WSJ story published several days ago, which said that SpaceX is looking at ways to develop small and inexpensive satellites that can enable Internet access around the world. The report said that Musk is working with former Google Inc. executive Greg Wyler, who founded WorldVu Satellites, on the project. The article also stated that SpaceX is considering launching about 700 satellites, each weighing less than 250 pounds, or half the size of the smallest communications satellites currently used. The fleet would also be 10 times bigger than the largest current fleet, managed by Iridium Communications. As a caveat, Musk stated that the WSJ story made several errors, though he didn’t say what they were. @RolfeWinkler No, WSJ was wrong on several important points. The article shouldn’t have been written on rumor and hearsay. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 11, 2014 Featured Image: NASA/NOAA GOES Project</Content></Article>
