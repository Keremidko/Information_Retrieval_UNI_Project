TechCrunch has officially arrived to rock the socks off of the Seattle tech scene, and more importantly, to be rocked ourselves by the startups blossoming out of the Northwest. We’ll be hitting up Neumos on Thursday evening from 6pm to 10pm, during which time we’ll have an always-fun, rapid fire pitch-off competition where a few early-stage startups will have the opportunity to pitch their product to a panel of judges and a fine audience in under 60 seconds. It’s a blast to participate in, and potentially even more fun to watch happen, which is why you should buy tickets if you haven’t already. 21+ please. At the end of the day, these meetups are a great opportunity to network with local investors and entrepreneurs, to recruit potential developers or engineers for your company, or to simply have a great night focusing on what we all have in common: a love for technology. So show up. I’ll be looking for you. Online Ticketing for TechCrunch Meetup: Seattle June 12, 2014 powered by Eventbrite</Content></Article>
