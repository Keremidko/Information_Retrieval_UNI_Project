So, when we see something we like, we tend to share it with you guys. Like the TSOVET Time watches, they are pretty cool and resemble avionic instruments. And now, they’re on sale. Movements are swiss, leathers are Italian and the stainless is aeronautical-grade. Pretty top-notch stuff. Right now there is free shipping on the watches at Watchismo.com with the code TSOVETISMO, offer ends Jan 31st. If I had to go with one, I’d go with the SVT-AT76 in all black (pictured above). Price is $595.</Content></Article>
