This brings the company’s total funding to over $50 million. The company, which was founded by the former Chief Scientist of Amazon, and former Chief Strategy Officer of IBM Smarter Commerce, offers data analytics software that uses retailer data like views, inventory and purchase history to make better decisions around customer service, merchandising, fulfillment and more. Specifically, the company’s SaaS helps retailers to understand the what is driving sales and growth on an e-commerce site and what isn’t working. For example, the software will be able to tell which products a retailer is promoting are selling out, and how it is affecting customer satisfaction. In 2013, eCommera processed and analyzed more than $4 billion in online orders for 70 brands across 32 countries, including Neiman Marcus, Brooks Brothers, Clarins, Sur la Table, Calendars.com, and more. As John Squire, President, eCommera North America, explained to me, as more retailers put inventory online, they are looking for ways to understand merchandising, customer service strategy and more. In terms of competition, the company goes head to head with IBM and others.</Content></Article>
