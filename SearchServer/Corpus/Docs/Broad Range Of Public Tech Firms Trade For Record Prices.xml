Today, Apple, TubeMogul and Arista Networks set new record highs. TubeMogul and Arista both recently went public. Other firms, like Microsoft are trading near local maximums. MobileIron set an all-time high yesterday, managed a new intra-day high today, and is up strongly in the past few trading sessions. Facebook is toying with the $75 price per-share range, a record performance. That we’re seeing companies head public is therefore not surprising. Companies that are losing monday on a GAAP, and non-GAAP basis are looking to raise hundreds of millions from investors — LendingClub filed to raise $500 million today, Box wants $250 million and so forth. The buoyancy, of course, extends outside of the technology industry. The S&amp;P 500 closed at another record today, implying that a broader set of industries’ stocks are doing quite well. There are notable exceptions. Twitter remains far under its 52-week high. King Digital has taken a beating in recent days. But the larger market for tech stocks appears healthy. At least for now, the IPO window looks open, and Silicon Valley is sunny. Featured Image: Antonio Morales García/Flickr UNDER A CC BY-SA 2.0 LICENSE</Content></Article>
