I’m all for modularity and being able to upgrade components individually in a powerhouse computer like the Mac Pro, but $279 for an 8800GT? The card you’re getting is fully $100 cheaper on the street even for a good brand like XFX or PNY (nice deal there). Reminds me of the infamous Xbox 360 hard drive markup. I know many people will gladly pay a premium for Apple hardware, but this really isn’t even Apple hardware.</Content></Article>
