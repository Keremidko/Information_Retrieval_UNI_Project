But he spooked investors with projected losses going into next year. The growth investors who remained in the stock started fleeing in after-hours trading, and this morning shares opened at $74.90, down 37 percent from a close of $119 yesterday. That $44 drop translates into $2.3 billion worth of Netflix market cap getting wiped out in a single night. Netflix’s current market cap is just shy of $4 billion, down from more than $16 billion at its peak last July. LinkedIn, with a market cap of $8,6 billion, is now worth twice as much as Netflix. Did Wall Street overreact? If you believe that streaming video is the future of movies and TV, this could be a buying opportunity. Just bought some $NFLX after hours. I'd be less bullish if they weren't already so far ahead of most of the content world's thinking. — Chris Sacca (@sacca) October 24, 2011</Content></Article>
