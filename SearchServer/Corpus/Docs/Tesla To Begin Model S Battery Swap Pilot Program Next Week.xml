Starting next week, it’s launching the pilot program of that advancement in Harris Ranch, California, at a new facility directly across the street from the Supercharger in that area. The pilot project is just that – an initial demonstration of how the system will work, designed to test the technical aspects of the procedure, and to see if it’s something Tesla drivers actually want. Unlike a recharge of their car’s existing battery pack, the swap won’t be free: instead it will cost “slightly less than a full tank of gasoline for a premium sedan,” according to Tesla’s official blog post on the matter. That could change in the future, but the swap involves labor and facility costs that charging does not. Swaps also require setting an appointment in advance, and the process currently takes three minutes, although Tesla anticipates a time when it could take a minute or less. But continued development, and wider rollout, will once again depend on Model S owner interest. For some, the cost of tank of gas might be a primary reason for owning an electric vehicle, but something tells me Tesla’s more rarefied clientele could indeed get excited about trading that extra cash for a little more convenience, especially on long trips.</Content></Article>
