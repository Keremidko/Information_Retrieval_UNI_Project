The company was launched in March 2013 by Tudou founder Gary Wang after Tudou merged with Youku, creating China’s biggest streaming video site and aspires to make high-quality computer animated films with a “Chinese cultural touch.” Light Chaser, which has spent the past year and a half filling out its art, technology, and management rosters, also said that its first 3D animated feature, “Little Door Spirits,” will be completed by July 2015 with a budget of RMB 70 million (about $12 million). While “Little Door Spirits” won’t be released for another year at least, Light Chaser has released a short film called “Little Yeyos” as a preview of what it can do. In a statement, Jixun Foo, managing partner at GGV Capital, said “The movie market in China is booming, and certainly there is a very significant growth space for Chinese animated feature films. We are impressed by the vision and execution capability of Light Chaser. Within a very short period of time, they have built up an excellent team and a world-class animation production pipeline. It’s very exciting that Light Chaser’s animation and CG capabilities are already at a level close to Hollywood.”</Content></Article>
