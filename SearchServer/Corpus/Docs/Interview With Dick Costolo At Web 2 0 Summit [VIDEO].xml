When moderator John Battelle began the talk referencing a quote from a recent Chicago Tribune article, “Costolo’s job is to turn 140 characters emanating from the fingertips of Snooki, Anthony Weiner and Kim Kardashian into a money-making machine strong enough to withstand a bubble bursting,” Costolo himself chimed in with, “… This task seemingly insurmountable for a man of such limited distinction.” Highlight: Battelle’s grilling of Costolo regarding Google’s recent announcement of hashtags and realtime search on Google+; “It’s early days,” Costolo began, to which Battelle responded, “That’s such a bad answer … ‘It’s early days’… ‘It’s not a zero sum game’ .. Can I answer for you?” “A person can’t throw out a topic sentence any more,” Costolo quipped back, adding to the overall self-awareness of an already pretty self-aware interview (at some point the two throw around possible blog post headlines that could result from the interview — And Battelle mistakenly refers to me as ‘Alexis’). It’s worth watching for at least a half hour or so in, if only to experience a prominent tech CEO with such a finely honed sense of the absurd.</Content></Article>
