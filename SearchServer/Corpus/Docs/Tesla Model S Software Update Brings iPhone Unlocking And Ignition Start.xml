The system adds a bunch of new features for Model S vehicles, including a new Calendar app for in-car use, and big improvements to the Maps/Navigation software. What’s amazing (and surprising) for iPhone users is that they can now unlock and start their car from their devices if they forget their physical key fob at home. The update is yet another indication of Tesla’s commitment not only to future customers, but also to existing vehicle owners. Musk announced just last week that the Model S would get a warranty extension for its drive train of infinite miles for up to eight years. Bringing major changes to the in-car software system post-purchase is another deviation for the standard operating procedure for vehicle owners, and letting them use their smartphones as remote access and remote starters is ordinarily an expensive aftermarket upgrade. Basically Tesla needs to make these cars affordable for ink-stained hacks like myself stat. The new $35,000 Tesla Model 3 is now official, but its limited range makes it less appealing, and we have to wait until 2017 for it to go on sale. Until then, I guess I’ll just have to stick with envy.</Content></Article>
