The move helps those on Windows Phone, BlackBerry, iOS and Android who are too lazy to pick up their phones to order. (Several TechCrunchers in the office have done this multiple times. I may or may not be one of them.) The new website has everything users have come to expect from the mobile version, including looking at different merchant stores and restaurants, ordering, tracking your delivery and entering payment or location info. If you place an order from your browser, it also shows up in the app, and vice-versa. In a chat on the phone yesterday, Postmates CEO Bastian Lehmann laid out how the web app will increase usage. With ordering via the web now an option, Postmates is pushing for merchant partners to send traffic its way with big “Order with Postmates” buttons, as seen on The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen’s home page: He’s also betting that it’ll make the startup’s newsletter convert better. “Newsletters have deeplinks that point straight to the options in your area, which can make them more effective when you’re checking email from the office.” Featured Image: Postmates</Content></Article>
