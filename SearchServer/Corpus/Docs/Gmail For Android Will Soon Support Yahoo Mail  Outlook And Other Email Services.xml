Own an Android device? Not a fan of Gmail? There’s good news coming your way. Google is preparing a major update for Gmail for Android that will, among many things, finally handle email accounts from other service providers, such as Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo and AOL [mandatory disclaimer: AOL is, of course, the owner of TechCrunch]. That’s according to the sleuths at Android Police, who discovered evidence of a redesigned app that is expected to launch soon. Update: The Verge also points out that POP, IMAP and Exchange are also supported. You can glimpse a look at the unified Gmail app for Android in the video tour below, which was surfaced by Android Police. The refreshed looking app — which follows Google’s new Material Design language — includes round icons, a clean and bright design and, most notably, said support for third-party email accounts. We expect this update to roll out this week and suspect that this update has been anticipated by loyal Google customers for some time. Apple’s iOS has long supported multiple email accounts, so you Android folks out there will finally get on par — although, to be honest, if you’re still using antiquated email services today, then you’ve only got what you deserve up to this point. That’ll be one less excuse for not responding to your boss’s email, anyway. Headline image via Cairo / Flickr Featured Image: Cairo/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE</Content></Article>
