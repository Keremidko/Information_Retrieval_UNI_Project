Alas, no such luck. Based on product pages that have just gone up on AT&amp;T, it looks like the Fire will sell for roughly the same price you’d expect any other phone to go for on a two-year contract. Meanwhile, product pages that have just gone up on Amazon’s own site detail the off-contract prices. As rumored, AT&amp;T is getting this phone as a carrier exclusive. The breakdown, so far: $199 for the 32GB model on a 2-year contract, $649 without contract $299 for the 64GB model on a 2-year contract, $749 without contract These prices may change as the announcement rolls on (Amazon still hasn’t officially confirmed the prices), but for now they’re looking accurate. Update: Amazon has now confirmed the above prices.</Content></Article>
