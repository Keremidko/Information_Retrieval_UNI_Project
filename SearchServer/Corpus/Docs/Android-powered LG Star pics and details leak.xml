Well, a member of the Android Forums managed to get his hands on one, and has done a little photo-shoot with it. He’s also unearthed a name and some specs. First up, the name: LG Star. No idea if that’ll make it to retail, but that’s what it’s called at the moment. Next up, specs: We already knew that it had a blazin’-fast Tegra 2 processor, an 8MP Camera, 1080p video, front-facing camera, and 15000mAh battery. Today’s leak confirms the screen resolution as 800×480 (but doesn’t mention the 4″ size), and adds an HDMI out port, but also brings the sad news that our hopes of a “stock” Android build have been dashed, as you can see in the notifications screenshot. You can check a few more pics in the gallery below, or hit up the source link to see a few more. Will bring you more details as they arise. [via Android Community]</Content></Article>
