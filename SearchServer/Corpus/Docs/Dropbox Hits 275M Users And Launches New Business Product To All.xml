Dropbox for Business competes with a cadre of competing services like OneDrive for Business and Box’s product set. The updated service will, according to the company, provide users with two Dropbox buckets, one for personal and one for work. The company hints that users won’t struggle to move between them, stating that users will be able to “easily access both Dropboxes from any of their devices.”  In practice — I just got hands-on time — this means that users fire up Dropbox, and then select their work or personal account. Both are logged-in, and switching between the two takes just a moment. It’s impressively seamless. The company also announced that it now has 275 million users. That figure is sharply higher than the 200 million users that the company indicated it had in November 2013. The company also stated that it now has nearly 700 employees. Financially, Dropbox has been on something of a roll lately, raising $350 million in a sale of equity valuing the company at around $10 billion, and picking up a $500 million credit facility that should provide it with extensive capital flexibility as it looks to go public. Also announced this morning by Dropbox is something called Project Harmony. As TechCrunch just reported: Project Harmony lets Dropbox users see when other people with whom they are sharing documents, and have discussions with them. On the surface, it seems similar to built in functions in Google Documents — but in the Microsoft suite of applications.
