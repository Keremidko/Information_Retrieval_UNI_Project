Now it’s adding another: Starting today, the cable network is making its WatchESPN app available through Google’s popular Chromecast dongle. The addition of Chromecast will allow users who already have the WatchESPN iOS or Android apps to send those streams directly to their televisions with the latest update. That’ll allow them to watch live broadcasts from a wide range of the company’s channels, including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPN3, ESPNEWS, and ESPN Deportes. Of course, this won’t be available to everyone — users will have to authenticate with their cable logins to prove that they pay for the content. But that’s nothing new in today’s TV Everywhere world. The launch comes just ahead of ESPN’s coverage of 2014 FIFA World Cup, which will include every single match of the soccer tournament. But it follows the introduction of the WatchESPN app on a number of platforms, including Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Apple TV. For ESPN, more supporting devices means more viewers, which eventually means more advertising revenue. That’s something that its corporate cousins ABC and Disney Channels will be working to do as well, as they have plans to launch their own Chromecast support soon. Image Source</Content></Article>
