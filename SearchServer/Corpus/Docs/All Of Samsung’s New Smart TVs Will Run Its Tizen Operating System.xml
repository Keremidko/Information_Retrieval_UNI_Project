In theory, this means that the new smart TVs will be able to sync with other Samsung devices that use Tizen, the company’s own open-source operating system. For example, they can stream content over wi-fi or connect automatically by Bluetooth. In its announcement, Samsung said its “Tizen’s compatibility with other devices establishes Samsung’s Smart TVs as the control center of any Smart Home.” This, of course, means that Samsung will have to drum up developer interest in the OS, which was first announced in 2012, but so far as failed to emerge as a viable competitor to Android. That hasn’t stopped Samsung rolling out products use Tizen. The decision to build Tizen into all of its smart TVs isn’t a surprise because Samsung has previously said that the Tizen-based smart TV software development kit will replace its former smart TV developer platform. Tizen is also used in smartphones like the Samsung Z and Galaxy Gear and Samsung Gear S smartwatches. The launch of the Samsung Z has been postponed, however, and the majority of Samsung’s products still use Android, so the future of Tizen as an ecosystem remains unclear.
