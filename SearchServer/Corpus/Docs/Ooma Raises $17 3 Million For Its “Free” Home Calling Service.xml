Ooma also has international calling plans, starting at a penny a minute to call 60 different countries. Marketing exec Jim Gustke tells me that the 50 person, Palo Alto based company will be using the new funds to expand its marketing efforts and will be revealing new product developments at CES. “Stay tuned!” Gustke says.</Content></Article>
