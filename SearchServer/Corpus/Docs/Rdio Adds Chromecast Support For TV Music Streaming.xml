What that means is that you’ll be able to send your Rdio music from your iPhone, iPad, Android phone, Chrome for Mac and Chrome for Windows to your Chromecast-connected TV or HDMI display wirelessly. Using Rdio’s existing remote feature, you’ll also be able to control playback on the Chromecast from anywhere you’re logged into your Rdio account. As with other Chromecast-enabled apps, the icon for Chromecast discovery now appears in the Rdio apps on iOS, Mac and Chrome. If you’ve already set up your Chromecast, it should appear when you click the icon and you can get streaming right away. Rdio had previously announced it would be bringing Chromecast support to its service, but rival Spotify has yet to add support for Google’s streamer, though it does offer its own Spotify Connect Wi-Fi audio streaming protocol. Updates for the iOS apps and the Android apps should be available soon, and the feature is live on the web, too.</Content></Article>
