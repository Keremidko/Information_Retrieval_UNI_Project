The page includes a brief one-paragraph explainer about why the company was a good fit, and expressing optimism for what the companies can do together in the future. A link on the page, which features a background image of a pair of Beats by Dre headphones, directs visitors to the Beats website, which itself features a redesign and a new message that includes a brief history of Apple’s contributions to music, and declares today the beginning of a new joint journey between Apple and Beats. Apple had received clearance from the European Commission to go ahead with the acquisition of Beats earlier this week, and today also marks the official transfer of the 13 percent of Beats Music owned by Vivendi/Universal Music Group from that organization to Apple. Apple’s acquisition is now approved in the U.S. as well, Apple confirmed to TechCrunch, which explains why both companies have now officially publicized their merging on consumer-facing channels. This week Apple confirmed that there will be some streamlining of the Beats team as they transition operations to underneath the Apple umbrella, as reported by 9to5Mac. The company said in a statement that it will initially offer jobs to all existing Beats employees, but noted that some would be temporary as there exists “overlap” in the operations of the two organizations.
