Here’s a fun little autofill option that the Drive team has put into place to help you list out popular beers. Simply type the word “lager” in the A1 cell of the spreadsheet and then “ipa” in the A2 cell. Highlight both, hold the option key (or CTRL for you Windows users) and drag the bottom cell down. You’ll get something that looks like this: Someone at Google really likes beer, and if you’re ever looking for a way to find an infinite number of options to place into a spreadsheet, now you know how to.
