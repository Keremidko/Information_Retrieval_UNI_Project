If you somehow snag an iPhone on launch day, you’ll probably want some sort protective case in order to protect your hot new toy. (‘Cause let’s be real: it’s just a toy for grown-ups.) Pacific Rim’s iShield should keep your Precious safe and sound from the horrors of everyday life. Though there’s no screen protector, the synthetic leather case looks like it’s more than strong enough to insulate the iPhone from most minor bumps and bruises. Emphasis on the “most.” It’s only $35, which, while seeming expensive for a piece of faux leather, is not even 6 percent the price of the iPhone itself.
