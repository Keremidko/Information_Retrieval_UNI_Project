The SSD T1 also comes in smaller, 256 gigabyte and 500 gigabytes versions. The device will retail for between $179 and $599, depending on how much storage capacity you need. The T1 ships this month. In an age when cloud storage is both ubiquitous and free, you might find it odd that Samsung is working to sell what appears to be a USB memory stick on steroids. But uploading content over Wi-Fi networks can be laborious, and LTE networks are even worse. So sometimes when it comes to lots of data, going old school can be the better option. (The old joke about underestimating the bandwidth of a car full of hard drives skipping down a highway is apropos here.) It will be interesting to see if markets outside of the creative professions, which often deal with large files that need to be moved around, and shared, find the T1 attractive.</Content></Article>
