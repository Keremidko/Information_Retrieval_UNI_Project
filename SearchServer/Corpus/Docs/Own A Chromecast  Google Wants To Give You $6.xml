Pretty much the only thing* that would make it better is if Google randomly gave you free money for owning one. (*except for 5ghz WiFi support, that’d be good too.) What do you know! That’s what they’re doing today. As noted by Android Authority, Google is giving out $6 in Google Play credits to Chromecast owners. One catch: it seems to be U.S.-only as far as I can tell. The idea is that you’ll use the $6 to rent some ooey-gooey romance movie over Valentine’s weekend… but you’re also free to use it to beef up your Clash Of Clans village, if that’s more your thing. Redeeming the offer is super straightforward: Make sure you’re connected to the same network as your Chromecast. Open the Chromecast iOS/Android app Tap your device, then find the “Check For Offers” button (it should be hiding behind the three-dot button in the upper-right) Confirm your Chromecast serial number with Google Tada! You can also do this from your laptop at this link right here. Some folks who own multiple Chromecasts report being able to redeem the offer once for each of their devices while using the mobile app.</Content></Article>
