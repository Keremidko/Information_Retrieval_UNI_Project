Netflix is currently the biggest subscription-based video streaming service in the U.S. with just under 38 million streaming video subscribers. But perhaps due to a later launch and stronger offerings from local players, it has yet to repeat that trick elsewhere. Collectively across the rest of the markets where Netflix is active, it has just over 15 million subscribers. Still, in its Q3 earnings, the company noted that the bulk of its growth was coming from international markets — adding two international users for every user in the U.S. — so it’s no surprise to see it expanding those services now. Other local content will include Virunga and Mission Blue, and stand-up comedy specials Uganda Be Kidding Me, Live, from Chelsea Handler and Jim Jefferies&#146;s BARE — and it will be expanding that to include original series Bloodline; Marvel&#146;s Daredevil; Sense8; and Grace.
