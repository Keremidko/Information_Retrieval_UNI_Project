The company, which raised $15 million in 2012 will use the cash to move further into mobile and to expand their global reach. “We’re already operational in every country in the world,” said CEO Slava Rubin. “We’ve been able to grow 300% in Europe over the year and we’re planning on adding more currencies and languages for more countries.” “There will also be a lot of focus on mobile and on personalizion and trust,” he said. Additional funders include Insight Venture Partners, MHS Capital, Metamorphic Ventures and ff Venture Capital. The company has come off a banner year with a number of high-profile projects including the Mistfit Shine, the Canary, and a number of notable movies and books (Full Disclosure: myself included.) The company has hosted 190,000 campaigns from 190 countries. Rubin said he was most excited about Indiegogo’s appearances at CES 2014 where 40 Indiegogo-funded companies showed their completed projects. I asked him if he’d ever consider crowdfunding his next equity round. He said it wasn’t off the table. “Equity crowdfunding is coming in 2014,” he said. “We’re staying closely connected to that.”</Content></Article>
